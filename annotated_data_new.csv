2015-2017,gillan,cheryl,27/05/2015,political system,1,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,230,My hon Friend has an impeccable record of providing services but if he could provide me with my step free access I would be even happier I was pleased to see that the valuable work of the Silk commission is being taken forward in this Session but I hope that the long overdue boundary changes and reduction in the number of MPs will also be taken forward The Labour Government reduced the number of Scottish MPs when the Parliament received primary law making powers and that should have happened also for Wales when the National Assembly received its law making changes We are keen to rebalance the economy between north and south and east and west but we also need to rebalance the representation in this House An English MP s work remit is arguably considerably different from that of the MPs for Scotland and Wales who have Assembly Members and Members of the Scottish Parliament to carry out a proportion of the work that we do as English MPs I very much hope that the changes to Standing Orders will deal with the perennial problem of the West Lothian question which has still not been answered I could not speak in the debate without mentioning my pet project of which I am a great fan HS2 as high speed rail is mentioned in the Queen s Speech In the previous Parliament the final compensation scheme was announced but after five years the current scheme is still falling short of the fair and generous settlement that the Prime Minister promised Constituents are having their lives and finances dissected and investigated in the sort of detail that could be said to be normally associated with bankruptcy or criminal proceedings Even decisions on whether the Government should purchase their properties sometimes seem to be subject to lifestyle judgments being made by officials In addition the residents commissioner who was appointed last January has yet to agree to a meeting with me and has not published her quarterly report that was promised However hope springs eternal I was delighted that in our manifesto the Government will be maintaining the national protections for areas of outstanding natural beauty national parks and sites of special scientific interest As only 45 of the Chilterns AONB is currently fully tunnelled leaving 11 4 km of the widest area of the AONB destroyed by shallow cuttings and so called green tunnels I feel sure that the fully bored tunnel which will protect the entire AONB must now be firmly on the Government s agenda In my view this is the only way of mitigating damage to our rare habitat and fulfilling this vital commitment in the Conservative manifesto,27/05/2015,25,England,positive
2015-2017,norman,jesse,02/06/2015,fabric of society,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,466,I congratulate all those who have given their maiden speeches in this Queen s Speech debate today and on previous days We have seen a galaxy of talent and it has been a delight to listen to them I feel like a thorn amid a garland of roses I also take my hat off to the hon Member for Bristol West Thangam Debbonaire  now departing for her elegant misattribution of my great hero Burke for which I thank her Having won my seat in 2010 I am not in a position to give a maiden speech but I am pleased to report to the House that the voters of Hereford and South Herefordshire have returned me with a majority that increased from 2 500 to just under 17 000 It has always been my aspiration to make my seat one where they weigh the vote rather than count it and I am pleased to report that we are making a little progress in that direction With that progress comes responsibility and I want to dwell on that a little We had the Hay festival all last week on the edge of my constituency an extraordinary gathering of ideas and words and music bringing people together from across this country indeed across the world It is an extraordinary institution and one of which I have had the honour to be a director for the past few years The festival I am talking here not so much about health and social care in the strict sense as about the health and care of our society more widely formed a fascinating contrast with our proceedings in Parliament For the Queen s Speech had many excellent elements within it enterprise finance education immigration cities and the EU referendum to name just a few and it had a heavily economic focus as befits the times in which we live But it was striking that the list of Bills barely touched or touches the areas of arts and culture social care in the wider sense that I have described It was doubly striking in the light of the many excellent speeches that we have heard in the past few days Time and again they returned to the role of culture of soft power in supporting and advancing our understanding of ourselves and our place in the wider world I think of the spat mentioned yesterday between Charles I and his wife Henrietta Maria in 1621 which was healed by the soft breezes of rural Hampshire as my hon Friend the Member for Fareham Suella Fernandes pointed out while from the opposite side of the Chamber the hon Member for Birmingham Edgbaston Ms Stuart rightly highlighted the importance of the English language and of British norms and values in our foreign policy This House is no friend to abstract ideas and I am pleased to say that it is not but it is worth asking ourselves what we mean by culture For some it is The best that has been thought and said in the world  For others it is the diffusion and extension of knowledge within a society There is something in both definitions We have a staggeringly rich and diverse national culture in this country Indeed in many ways ours is among the very richest and most diverse cultures in the world today But that knowledge that culture cannot exist unless it is shared unless it is diffused and extended as Cardinal Newman put it And it must be diffused and extended across the whole country But Mr Deputy Speaker this is not the case today Let me pick out two areas in which I suggest that we need early and resolute action from the Government to support the diffusion of culture The first is communications Vast areas of our country still do not have decent broadband fast or otherwise Vast areas of our country struggle to get a decent mobile signal This affects rural areas and some urban areas in England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland alike We need an urgent action task force led by Government but involving local government and the private and third sectors to review how these issues can be swiftly resolved and then to resolve them My second area over and above communications has to do with what is communicated with knowledge with understanding and the value of education which are the cornerstones of our culture Over the past five years the Government led by the Conservative party have made great strides in education almost across the entire age spectrum but one crucial group has been left out indeed worse the group s great achievements have arguably been put at a certain amount of risk I mean our sixth form colleges which have an extraordinary record of educating young people at low cost and to high quality Mr Deputy Speaker we need to do something about this collectively in this Parliament We need to do something about communications rural broadband and a rural mobile signal We need to do something about the diffusion of our culture across our country and the way in which we educate our young people in our sixth form colleges This Government have rightly laid claim to the mantel of one nation and have done so in the name of compassionate conservatism but that inclusiveness that fellow feeling demands that everyone be equally able to enjoy our history and our traditions and share in the endlessly dynamic and creative culture that is Britain For that we need better broadband and better mobile signals and we need to support our sixth form colleges To those ends I hope that the Government will be able to introduce measures swiftly to address the issues that I have raised,02/06/2015,271,England,positive
2015-2017,leslie,chris,04/06/2015,external relations,0,43,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Labour,242,I beg to move an amendment at the end of the Question to add  but regret that the Gracious Speech fails to provide a strategy to build the productive economy that the country needs note that a fragile recovery and stagnating productivity harms living standards and makes it harder to reduce the deficit believe that every effort should now be concentrated on supporting middle and lower income working people further note that the Gracious Speech is a missed opportunity to tackle the principal causes of rising welfare costs that flow from a low wage high rent economy further believe in the pooling and sharing of resources across the UK as the best mechanism for delivering social and economic change urge the Government to pursue sensible savings in public expenditure as part of a balanced approach and not an ideologically driven attempt to shrink public services beyond what is needed to address the deficit and call upon Ministers to spell out where their cuts will fall and who will pay for their unfunded election pledges  I welcome the Chancellor to his place Very few people serve two full terms as Chancellor and I am sure that the whole country will be grateful that he does not plan to do so either Although he might have his eye on another job I congratulate him on his reappointment to this one Of course we should not ignore the fact that he has a fancy new title to illustrate his role in the EU renegotiation process He is now the First Secretary of State no less following in the footsteps of John Prescott and Peter Mandelson Let us hope that his ministerial counterparts are suitably impressed The Chancellor must now deliver negotiations with other member states to convince the public to opt decisively for Britain to remain a member of the European Union It is important to secure stronger rules so that welfare payments go only to those who have contributed to our system but in my view we also need greater devolution from Brussels an overhaul of the EU budget and far greater accountability of the main institutions of the European Union which still feel too distant and out of touch It is also essential that he agrees that we need a comprehensive independent risk analysis of Britain leaving the European Union It needs to be carried out by the Bank of England the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility and it needs to be published in ample time for the public to consider it in full before the referendum Although this is not the Queen s Speech that I wanted the House to be debating I reassure everybody and remind the Chancellor that we will be a vigilant and responsible Opposition watching closely the choices he still has to make and holding him to account at every step,04/06/2015,421,England,positive
2015-2017,carmichael,alistair,08/06/2015,freedom and democracy,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Liberal Democrats,489,It is a pleasure to follow three exceptionally fine maiden speeches As convention demands I should like to say a few words about them before the hon Member for South Leicestershire Alberto Costa leaves his place As one former Scottish solicitor to another I welcome him to the House Maiden speeches always teach us something new that we did not know about a certain part of the world before I confess that I always thought the world s longest runway was at Machrihanish but I say that only because the hon Gentleman went on to give an impressive list of community names villages and towns within his constituency I am sure that the sound we might have heard in the background was the silent sobbing of Hansard writers trying to get the full list from him He will soon learn I have no doubt that such lists bring a swift note from the Hansard writers The hon Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West Margaret Ferrier has obviously already learned one important thing about the House of Commons that if one wants to get on here one has to keep in with the Doorkeepers She too delivered her first speech with passion and humour Knowing the part of the world she represents as I do I have no doubt that she will need both these qualities as she represents her constituents in the years ahead Finally we heard from the hon Member for Eddisbury Antoinette Sandbach  who spoke first of all for her farming constituents As a farmer s son representing a farming constituency myself I am pretty sure that we will all recognise elements of common concerns shared between her part of the world and mine I was particularly impressed by the way in which she brought in her own wider life experience She gave a thoughtful maiden speech and she will always be listened to in this House Let me add my welcome for this Bill on Second Reading tonight It is not yet fully nine months since the Smith commission was established In that time there have been a series of deadlines which as the Secretary of State indicated have all been met or exceeded and today s is just one of the long line It is worth remembering that we had a report the heads of agreement from Lord Smith and his commissioners by the end of November There was then the publication of draft clauses and the Command Paper by the end of January Then there was a commitment in all three manifestos to bring forward legislation in the first Queen s Speech and an early introduction of the Bill I commend the Government on having brought it forward today and I wish it a swift passage This Bill has already been the subject of some substantial and detailed scrutiny Other hon Members have spoken about the report of the Scottish Parliament special committee on the extra powers to the Scottish Parliament and professional bodies such as the Law Society of Scotland have also given the Bill careful consideration The nine month gestation process in the context of these discussions has been undertaken at breakneck speed If we consider how long it took us to get through the constitutional convention in the 1990s or the time taken in the Calman commission and then in bringing forward the Scotland Bill which became the Scotland Act 2012 we can understand that to have got to this point within nine months is a considerable achievement I pay tribute to the right hon Gentleman the Secretary of State and his officials in the Scotland Office for the work they have done As a general principle I would rather have things right than quick but we have to appreciate that this is one of those occasions when we are going to have to do both To do that requires of us all a particular effort and for us all to proceed in good faith and with goodwill on all sides I hope the debate we have in the coming weeks will allow the widest possible range of opinions that reflect the issues discussed in the referendum and general election campaigns in Scotland As the hon Member for Edinburgh South Ian Murray said from the Opposition Dispatch Box the SNP s very significant achievement in returning 56 of the 59 MPs must be recognised and I hope they will bring forward amendments that reflect full fiscal autonomy or responsibility whatever term they choose to employ and they will tell us the detail of what they mean by the medium term The hon Member for Edinburgh East Tommy Sheppard said in an intervention that in the course of the election campaign his party s policy had been the subject of grotesque caricature If that is the case as an elected representative he now has the opportunity in this place to put that right and I hope he and his colleagues will introduce amendments so we can have a proper debate My objection to full fiscal autonomy remains that in my view it constitutes effectively independence by the back door and therefore it does not respect the decision we reached as a nation last September The words of caution I give tonight are not directed only at the SNP They extend to those in the Labour and Conservative parties who would seek to use this debate as some sort of bidding war between those on different sides of the border I am short of time tonight but this is my word of caution remember always that within this great family of nations that is the United Kingdom it is possible to break the Union from either side of the border We have always proceeded on the basis that we are a family where we give in and take out in different ways at different times I hope the Bill we have tonight will be the next stage in the evolution of that family and I look forward to taking part in its consideration in the weeks to come,08/06/2015,520,England,positive
2015-2017,amess,david,08/06/2015,political system,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,Conservative,440,Although it is a little disappointing that there is not a packed House to listen to what I have to say about Southend from looking around the Chamber I can see that we have the quality I congratulate my right hon Friend the Minister for Communities and Resilience on being re elected as the MP for Rayleigh and Wickford with a huge majority and my hon Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend East James Duddridge on similarly being re elected with a large majority I could not be more pleased that my right hon Friend will reply to this debate He is only too well aware that there are not too Members left who can recall a Conservative majority Government He and I worked together in the constituency of Basildon During that time we managed to change the public perception of Basildon and it became the magnificent town it is today We managed to turn round some negative things with two days to go we stopped the closure of the accident and emergency unit we stopped the destruction of a silver birch forest we saved three secondary schools from closure and we got 10 000 council houses which had been sold repurchased because of clay heave I mean this in the nicest sense possible but I say to my right hon Friend that now there is a Conservative Government and we are blessed with a Speaker who believes that every Member of Parliament elected to this place is equal and that all our voices will be heard I am absolutely determined that this Conservative Government whom I support will act not only on behalf of my constituents in Southend to make it an even better place than it is but on behalf of the country In future I do not expect Ministers just to pay lip service to what I am asking them to do I expect action and tonight is the start of the action At the end of this short debate I hope that my right hon Friend will see to it that Southend is granted city status In the position he now occupies my right hon Friend is following my right hon Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells Greg Clark  now the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and my right hon Friend the Member for Forest of Dean Mr Harper  now the Chief Whip who both responded to such debates when we were in the coalition Government Now we are a Conservative Government I fully expect city status to be granted to Southend In every respect Southend qualifies to be a city It certainly has its own distinct identity Southend s local authority has no overall control There are 22 Conservatives constituting far and away the largest party and the Labour Liberal Independent and UKIP councillors have joined together to prevent the Conservatives from controlling the authority Quite how that works from a philosophical point of view I do not know but there is no doubt that the Conservative council did a magnificent job in restoring the fortunes of Southend We enjoy excellent communication and transport links and the A127 and A13 have been upgraded The most recent development of which my right hon Friend is well aware is the extension of the Tesco junction along the A127 which has had to deal with congestion caused by employees at the RBS site and the Tesco Extra store and now with the presence of London Southend airport The extension has greatly relieved the congestion in the area I am not sure that constituents understand the constraints that affect Ministers Ministers cannot ask questions or initiate debates but I have discussed a number of points with my hon Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend East James Duddridge who is also the Under Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and our views on the local railway lines are very similar For instance c2c is absolutely magnificent When I was the Member of Parliament for Basildon it was known as the misery line It is now known as the happy line and I congratulate it on that However my hon Friend and I have some concerns about the Greater Anglia railway line I recently made a public journey on the line with the chief executive I was very frank with him I said I thought it was a rotten service The prices were too high and the rolling stock was clapped out I asked what he was going to do about it The Secretary of State for Transport has now opened up a bidding process and I understand that three companies are involved I hope that as local Members of Parliament all of whom enjoy or suffer this particular rail service there is just one station in my area namely Prittlewell we shall be consulted as the bidding process continues If I hear another colleague say that London Southend airport is fantastic I shall respond by saying that there is a very good side to it but also a slightly challenging side because the aircraft take off and land in my constituency and not all the residents who were there before the airport expanded are entirely delighted about the increased noise Nevertheless I entirely accept that last year it dealt with more than a million passengers I do not know whether my right hon Friend the Member for New Forest East Dr Lewis has flown from the airport,08/06/2015,549,England,positive
2015-2017,cleverly,james,10/06/2015,economy,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,371,I am obliged to you Madam Deputy Speaker for calling me to speak in this debate and I thank the hon Member for Southampton Test Dr Whitehead for a riveting speech Right hon and hon Members might not be aware that there is a town called Braintree in Massachusetts in America My predecessor Brooks Newmark embodied that transatlantic bridge as he was born in Connecticut before he came to the UK to go to school at the age of nine Those who knew Brooks will remember a fierce intellect that drove success at both Oxford and Harvard universities and in the financial services sector Any Member who was intimidated by that academic and commercial success need no longer fear now that I stand here in his stead Brooks was a Whip and a Minister and was well liked in the constituency He was a huge support to me during my campaign and he was also supportive of other candidates in target constituencies particularly my hon Friend the Member for Colchester Will Quince  It is fair to say that in the months after my selection Brooks and I hung out together quite a bit Since its creation Braintree has had a history of strong MPs Its first Tony Newton is still held up as a model constituency MP He was able to do that while negotiating a successful ministerial career in the House His Labour successor Alan Hurst was also highly spoken of despite serving for considerably less than Tony s 23 years Braintree has pre Roman roots and was a medieval market town but came into its own in the 16th century when Flemish weavers came to the town and brought with them their state of the art weaving techniques heralding 250 years of future prosperity Blooming foreigners The other town in my constituency is Halstead which is also famous for its weaving industry and is typified by a wide high street leading up to the church at the top of the hill from the River Colne which runs through the town My constituency stretches to the Suffolk border to its north and east and to Cambridgeshire in its north western corner and has a constellation of villages and hamlets scattered through it In that constellation are a number of binary stars including Earls Colne and White Colne Sible Heddingham and Castle Hedingham and Steeple Bumstead and Helions Bumstead There might be a degree of sibling rivalry between some of my villages It is best not to ask directions to the famously beautiful village of Finchingfield from either of the neighbouring villages Great Bardfield or Weathersfield It is appropriate in this climate change debate that I recognise the excellent work done by Braintree District Council Many of the buildings in my constituency are adorned with solar panels and I am a great believer in industrial residential agricultural and municipal buildings having solar panels perhaps on their roofs but I will fight hard to prevent the beautiful fields in my villages from being spoiled by row upon row of photovoltaic cells Small and medium sized businesses typify my constituency and I will fight hard on their behalf I hope the Government can help relieve congestion on the A120 a road so regularly and heavily congested that many drivers cut through Braintree in order to bypass the bypass Rail services need to be greatly improved to unlock the business potential in my constituency But transport infrastructure alone is not enough We also need digital infrastructure Mobile signals in the rural parts of my constituency are sorely needed as is superfast rural broadband These parochial issues important though they are are not the only reason that we are collectively sent to this place We live in an increasingly competitive global economy and we as a nation must rise to that challenge or be swept aside The challenge from former colonial countries now competing and in some cases overtaking us cannot be ignored Throughout our nation s history we have been at our best when we are globally focused on international trade when we are indeed a nation of shopkeepers I will fight for infrastructure investment in my constituency and for a good deal for my constituents but I will also fight to keep this nation an internationally focused competitive trading nation,10/06/2015,702,England,positive

2015-2017,cleverly,james,25/06/2015,fabric of society,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,307,There is a natural and proper tension between the desire for personal privacy and the need for national security In this afternoon s debate both sides of that argument have been discussed with the calmness and clarity that the issue merits Absolutist positions whether libertarian or on the side of state security are unhelpful They may be fun in university or school debating societies but in this place we have to think about the practical implementation of our discussions so it is welcome that Members in all parts of the House have taken pragmatic and logical positions I do not pretend to be an expert on security matters but I was part of the Metropolitan Police Authority at City Hall in London for a number of years I sat on its scrutiny committee which looked into the counter terrorism and protective services work of the Metropolitan police so in a small way I had some exposure to the security work that we demand our public servants conduct I was in small part one of those people who watched the watchmen The speed of change in communications is both exciting and frightening There was a time when communications interception meant snaring a carrier pigeon or steaming open a letter those days are long passed We are now in a world where state of the art encryption technology exists not just on traditional desktop or laptop computers but on every mobile phone and tablet that we carry around and in forms that people do not normally think of My sons regularly play on a games console and are able to communicate with their friends across the globe using encrypted communications technology I am pleased to say I am fairly sure that they do so with entirely innocent motivations but it does not take much of a leap of imagination to understand that people with much more sinister intent use such encrypted technology with ease So it is not enough for people to say that the current state of affairs is good enough and I welcome those parts of the Anderson report that highlight the fact that communications technology is moving apace The status quo is not good enough We are either at least trying to keep up or being left badly behind I was on the Metropolitan Police Authority when the student riots that afflicted Westminster took place and I remember how those protesters were able to move with great speed through London and in particular the time when they attacked the car carrying the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall The protesters were able to stay ahead of the police in a way that historically has not been possible For most of the recent history of the police they have been alone in being able to utilise peer to peer communications technologies the bobby s radio gave them a significant strategic advantage over those whom they sought to apprehend Those student protesters using BlackBerry Messenger which let us remind ourselves is five to six years out of date were able to stay well ahead of the police officers who were trying to do their duty I look at that incident as a very real and credible indicator of the challenge we now face at a national level The situation where the security services are potentially behind the curve is worrying and it needs addressing It is essential that we give our security services the tools they need to protect us but the counterbalance of that is also ensuring that there is proper scrutiny of the work they do In conclusion I suggest that our aim in this House and in this debate is to ensure that those who watch the watchmen are able to do so effectively and with real teeth but this should not be to prevent the watchmen from watching,25/06/2015,1346,England,negative
2015-2017,newlands,gavin,13/07/2015,political system,0,35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Scottish National Party,661,It gives me great pleasure to deliver my maiden speech to the House today as the first SNP Member of Parliament for my home of Paisley and Renfrewshire North The fact that it was our first victory has not been for lack of effort over the years My hon Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath Roger Mullin contested the seat in the 1990 by election He fought a brilliant and memorable campaign despite the fact that he was hindered by an eager but occasionally ineffective 10 year old boy called Gavin I should have been better By that point I was a veteran a seasoned campaigner keen to follow my dad to any political event Two other campaigns from around the same time that I am proud to have been part of were the one against the iniquitous poll tax and that against the closure of the Ravenscraig steel plant in the constituency of my hon Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw Marion Fellows  The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the Conservative Government rip the heart out of hard working families and communities right across Scotland That was the height of Thatcherism and her Government s policies caused untold damage to Scotland to our economy to our people and to our self confidence Little did we know it at the time but those decisions about Scotland made on our behalf in Westminster and Whitehall against overwhelming Scottish public opinion would cause a massive political shift in Scotland that would not only see the Conservatives all but wiped out for a generation but cause a depth of feeling so strong that a form of self government was inevitable Fast forward a quarter of a century however and here I stand and as we say back home  I ve brought hauners  I am immensely proud to be representing my home constituency of Paisley and Renfrewshire North where I have lived almost my entire life I was very fortunate to be able to vote in what was my old primary school and is now that of my two young daughters I would like to say a few words about my predecessor Jim Sheridan Jim was the Member of Parliament for the area for 14 years He was a dedicated constituency MP and I am sure that the whole House will want to join me in wishing Jim his family and his staff all the very best for the future Paisley and Renfrewshire North is one of the most diverse constituencies in Scotland with some of the poorest communities as well as some of the most affluent My own home town of Renfrew is a royal burgh and is known as the cradle of the Stuarts  It was also home to Scotland s first municipal airport and the RAF s 602 Squadron rather misnamed as the City of Glasgow Squadron or Glasgow s Ain Unfortunately Renfrew is also home to the constituency s latest food bank yet another symptom of the Tories ideological obsession with welfare cuts which are hitting not only the poor and the vulnerable but hard working families across Renfrewshire If we leave Renfrew and travel north west towards Inchinnan we pass the site of the battle of Renfrew of 1164 This relatively little known battle was actually one of the most significant civil battles in Scottish history Somerled the Lord of the Isles gathered an army 15 000 strong and marched on King Malcolm IV s forces After a bloody fight Somerled was slain on the battlefield alongside thousands of his followers before the remainder beat a hasty retreat The message that my hon Friend the Member for Na h Eileanan an Iar Mr MacNeil should take from that story is Dinnae mess with Renfrew  Just beyond Inchinnan we find the great new town of Erskine which is the second largest town in the constituency no less Indeed a study by the Post Office last year declared that Erskine was the second most desirable postcode in Scotland to live in As we continue westwards we pass the charming village of Bishopton On our journey down the Renfrewshire riviera we come across the lovely riverside village of Langbank which affords magnificent views down to the Firth of Clyde On a clear day Madam Deputy Speaker if you crane your neck and have good eyesight you may be able to see the obscenity of the Trident nuclear submarines as they slip and slither up the Clyde to Faslane We were well aware of the shoddy safety standards in the handling and transporting of nuclear warheads long before Able Seaman McNeilly s recent whistleblowing On the 11 January this year 50 mph gales were battering the west coast of Scotland As a result high sided vehicles were warned not to cross the Erskine bridge over the Clyde I am not sure about anyone else but the very last thing I want driving over a 150 foot bridge during such high winds is a convoy loaded with nuclear warheads Unbelievably that is exactly what the Ministry of Defence chose to do My colleagues and I will not only lead the fight for better maintenance and security of those weapons but ensure that the voices calling for the complete abolition of those obscene and senseless weapons of mass destruction are heard loud and heard often My constituency includes a number of affluent towns and villages such as Langbank Crosslee Bridge of Weir Brookfield and Houston although it should be noted that despite their relative wealth those areas still have pockets of deprivation Just outside Paisley lies Linwood another area deeply damaged for generations by Thatcherite economics The famous Linwood car plant which provided work for 13 000 people at its height had its Government support pulled and overnight the town was devastated Parts of Paisley including Whitehaugh and Ralston are slightly more affluent but certainly not without their issues Shortroods Gockston Ferguslie Park and Gallowhill all have pockets of deprivation but a people whose spirit is unbending in the face of Tory misery The House should note with deep regret and concern that the Paisley job centre has doled out the most sanctions in the west of Scotland that sanctions across Renfrewshire have soared by 148 since 2010 that the demand for the aid of food banks in Renfrewshire has exploded by 1 763 since 2012 and that one in five kids goes to bed hungry each night That is the legacy of the coalition Government it is the record of this Conservative Government and they should be ashamed The Budget will do nothing to lift any of those people out of poverty In fact it will have the reverse effect Countless children will before long find themselves living in poverty through no fault of their own but I am sure that they will be comforted by the fact that the Government s response to child poverty is to change the definition This Government believe that if they fiddle the figures to show what they want them to children and their families will as if by magic soon find themselves out of poverty and living a life of comfort The message that came from the Chancellor last week was clear do not work in the public sector do not have children do not be out of work and do not heaven forbid be a young person Over the last few weeks I have received countless messages from constituents who are growing increasingly frustrated and angry with the Tory Government s arrogance The Conservatives a party that was near routed in Scotland with the worst result in its history and with only one MP deign to tell Scots that we cannot have what we voted for in overwhelming numbers The Government must stop playing games with the Scottish electorate and devolve the powers as proposed without caveat without veto and without delay,13/07/2015,1941,Scotland,positive
2015-2017,gray,neil,14/07/2015,political system,0,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Scottish National Party,976,Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker for calling me to make my maiden speech in this most important of debates It is a pleasure to follow all the excellent maiden speeches we have heard this afternoon particularly that of my hon Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South Mhairi Black  She has just graduated with a first class degree in politics I suspect that her first class speech will be read by generations of her successors as political students It was brilliant powerful and moving In line with the Scottish National party being in trend in this place my hon Friend is now trending on Twitter I rise sharing some of the trepidation described in the maiden speeches of many of my predecessors including the former Leader of the Opposition John Smith The fact that he was humble enough to share his nervousness fills me with hope for the next few minutes If I can be half the parliamentarian and constituency representative that he was my constituents and I will be doing well I owe a huge debt of gratitude to a number of people for helping me to my place here today first my brilliant campaign team led so ably by Graham Russell and Michael Coyle my Scottish Parliament counterpart and former boss Alex Neil who first encouraged me to stand and whose example I wish to follow and my family particularly my wife Karlie and baby daughter Isla who are a constant source of love and support It will not be standing up to this most right wing of Tory Governments or indeed standing up for the good people of Airdrie and Shotts that I will find most challenging over the next five years it will be missing my family when I am here I am sure that is a sentiment shared by many others in this House Lastly I am incredibly grateful to the 23 887 people who voted for me on 7 May Fifty four per cent of voters in Airdrie and Shotts voted for an end to austerity for the Scottish Parliament to receive the full package of powers promised last year and for an end to the immoral and financially obscene Trident nuclear fleet While I am incredibly grateful to those who took journeys of varying difficulty to arrive at the decision to mark their cross next to my name and that of the SNP I want to make it clear to everyone in Airdrie and Shotts that I am here to represent you no matter which way you voted or if you voted at all The SNP won a decisive victory in Scotland because we put forward a credible alternative to austerity and we are recognised as the party of and for all of Scotland This result was many decades in the making We must not just be thankful for the work done by the First Minister and by my right hon Friend the Member for Gordon Alex Salmond  we must also thank the giants whose shoulders we stand on One of them comes to mind more than most for me personally As I prepared this speech and as I go about my business pursuing the various issues I plan to in this place I am truly sorry that I cannot seek the wise counsel of my friend Margo MacDonald Her experience here of the Parliament up the road and of life in general would have given all of us as new SNP Members valuable guidance It would also have been great to tease her about gaining only a 26 7 swing in her 1973 Glasgow Govan by election but I would have needed to be prepared for the inevitable stinging but witty rebuke that would have followed I must take this opportunity to pay tribute to my most immediate predecessor Pamela Nash with whom I shared a positive election campaign When Pamela took her seat in 2010 she was the baby of the House at just 25 a veteran compared with my hon Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South Her election was none the less a fantastic achievement She went on to represent her constituents to the very best of her ability and championed the cause of those with HIV AIDS around the world through her position as chair of the all party parliamentary group on HIV and AIDS I wish her well for whatever she chooses to do with the rest of her career Pamela Nash regularly spoke of her pride at representing Airdrie and Shotts and I am equally proud and humbled to be here to represent the good people of this constituency Airdrie and Shotts sits either side of the M8 motorway between Edinburgh and Glasgow and stretches from the Airdrie town boundary with Coatbridge in the west through to Harthill in the east To the north are Greengairs Wattston Riggend Longriggend Stand Glenmavis Plains and Caldercruix to the south are Holytown the birthplace of Keir Hardie Calderbank Chapelhall Salsburgh Newmains Bonkle Allanton Hartwood and Shotts which I hope will receive town status from North Lanarkshire Council very soon It is a constituency dominated by heavy industry Communities have literally been forged by mining steel and iron The grit determination and common weal needed for workers their families and communities to make ends meet has lived on from those days and I am proud to represent people who are warm generous and welcoming You need only look at the incredible work done by Airdrie Supporters Trust Getting Better Together in Shotts Shape up Shotts the Moira Anderson Foundation HOPE for Autism Basics food bank St Andrews Hospice Airdrie food bank and many more brilliant community groups who are supported by the kind hearted people of my constituency to know that the people I represent are as honest and generous as they come Looking back on the maiden speeches of some of my predecessors I was struck by the fact that there was a consistent theme running through them all and that is how we treat those who are disadvantaged and living in poverty in our society In that vein as I look to address this Chancellor s Budget statement I must quote what Margaret or Peggy Herbison said in her maiden speech on 17 October 1945  I realise that I have chosen a subject upon which one cannot be at all non controversial  This Government are plotting a path of social engineering with this Budget and by continuing their ideological austerity agenda For example saying that families on low wages can only receive support for two children is outrageous As my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow Central Alison Thewliss pointed out the fact that there needs to be a form for the victims of rape to register their child highlights everything that is wrong with this policy It is stigmatic demonising and utterly degrading Further cuts to social security will hit not only the poorest and most disadvantaged people in our society but ordinary working families The Tories plan to freeze working age benefits for the next four years which will fail to protect social security against rises in the cost of living They also plan to further marginalise young people by scrapping support for those who are under 25 and under 21 The Government must recognise that they cannot threaten demonise and sanction people into work After seven years working on casework in Airdrie and Shotts I am still to come across anyone who has chosen to live on social security That is why the Chancellor s comments about benefits being a lifestyle choice were inappropriate inflammatory and frankly ill judged People in my constituency are desperate for work that allows them a decent standard of living and that suits their skills and qualifications If they cannot work due to temporary illness or permanent disability or intermittently due to mental illness they rightly expect the support to meet minimum living standards There is no doubt that the best way to lift people out of poverty and indignity is through work but it must be well paid work The wholesale cuts to tax credits that the Chancellor has announced which include a reduction in the income threshold at which tax credits are paid remove any benefit from the minimal increase in the minimum wage For the Chancellor to attempt to present the proposed minimum wage rise as a living wage is a scandal The living wage is 7 85 an hour outside London so he is 65p short It is a con trick If he gives with one hand and takes back with another the people will not swallow it Freezing public sector pay at 1 for another four years yet again punishes those who are delivering vital front line services for the profligacy of the banks It was not the low paid it was not the disabled it was not the under 25s it was not the public sector workers who got the UK into dire financial straits so why is the Chancellor choosing repeatedly to kick the legs from underneath those who are struggling to stay on their feet We on these SNP Benches are opposed four square to the dismantling of the social security system by this Tory Government Earlier I quoted the maiden speech of Peggy Herbison who must be birling at the state of her proud party At the beginning of the sitting in which she delivered her maiden speech Sir Basil Neven Spence the then Member for Orkney and Shetland raised a point of order and begged the Speaker to allow Scottish Members to be called more frequently in the House Without wishing to prejudge Mr Deputy Speaker I doubt that you will need such a reminder of the presence of Scottish Members The Chair has certainly been more than fair thus far It strikes me that then as now the status of Scottish Members was under discussion although with the constitutionally kamikaze English votes for English laws proposal the status of Scottish MPs and as a result the Union hang far greater in the balance I am proud to hail from Orkney and a large chunk of my family and friends still live there I am reliably informed by the learned listeners of BBC Radio Orkney that I am the first Orcadian parliamentarian for 200 years since Malcolm Laing served in this House between 1807 and 1812 I hope that after next year s Scottish elections Orkney returns its first ever SNP representative I was proud as a schoolboy to carry the Orkney banner at the parade for the reopening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 It struck me then as a 13 year old that a nation having its own Parliament was perfectly normal Why on earth would we want decisions about us to be taken elsewhere On that note I will make my closing remarks As SNP MPs we are not here just to argue the case for the Scottish people we are here on behalf of the people of Scotland We want to build consensus where we find it to deliver progressive policies across these isles We are here to be a voice for change and we are determined that the voices of our constituents will be heard no matter which Standing Order the Government use to try to curb our right to represent them As we have seen with the Budget Scotland cannot afford for decisions over its people and resources to be taken here for much longer That is the ultimate change that we want to see independence for Scotland Benjamin Franklin said  When you are finished changing you re finished

2015-2017,eagle,angela,15/07/2015,freedom and democracy,1,54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Labour,112,In all of the three statements or speeches that I have made in the past three weeks I have begun by conceding exactly that point I have done it not for show but because it is what we believe The proposals mean that if a Government do not command a majority in England it is doubtful that they could actually govern The complete lack of effective consultation with any other party outside of Government on some of the controversial aspects of these proposals makes them partisan and divisive when they should have been accomplished on a cross party basis When it comes to making changes of such constitutional importance and technical complexity it is only right that they should be scrutinised effectively The Government s proposals fundamentally alter the constitution and the operations of this House as well as impacting on the other place In those circumstances it is appropriate to set up a Joint Committee of both Houses to consider the proposals in greater depth I call on the Leader of the House to do so Joint Committees of both Houses have a strong tradition of effective cross party scrutiny of complex issues of constitutional importance both legislative and non legislative For example the highly regarded Cunningham Committee looked at the non legislative issue of conventions between both Houses The report was noted with approval in both Houses in 2007 and has stood the test of time and sets a clear precedent on which the Government should now proceed,15/07/2015,2068,England,positive
2015-2017,penrose,john,07/09/2015,freedom and democracy,0,51,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Conservative,846,This is a very large group of amendments covering almost the entirety of the Bill it is late and I have less than 10 minutes so I shall skip lightly over anything covered during Committee stage with the Leader of the House and focus on the new points and the new areas raised this evening I commend all the Government amendments in the group and will try to summarise the most important ones briefly before moving on to some of the others in the group First there are amendments dealing with changes to the campaign rules They broadly have the support of the Electoral Commission and will ensure that the Bill and PPERA operate together and that campaigning is fair and transparent They include changes to allow the lead campaigns to be designated quickly if needed so that they do not cut into the short 10 week campaign period and to allow the Electoral Commission to reject applications from campaigners with offensive or obscene names Second are the amendments dealing with changes to the administration rules They are all technical and deal primarily with the interaction between UK law and Gibraltarian law Third are amendments responding to concerns raised by Members in previous debates to rule out holding the referendum on 4 May 2017 and to add Irish citizens resident in Gibraltar to the franchise I will deal first with clause 2 and the referendum franchise Quite a lot of this was dealt with in Committee and given the limited time I will have to skip very lightly over it I will however mention Government amendment 24 which makes a small change to permit Irish citizens resident in Gibraltar to vote in the referendum to bring equality to who can vote in the UK and Gibraltar The Government of Gibraltar support the change and I am pleased to see consensus across the House with an Opposition amendment for the same purpose amendment 18 having been tabled I am grateful to my hon and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham Stephen Phillips for raising the matter in Committee Given the limited time I have I do not propose to spend a great deal of time in fact any on votes at 16 because we covered it in Committee I will come back to the issue of EU citizens at the end if time allows but there is an awful lot of other ground to cover As I said the Government amendments on campaigning broadly have the support of the Electoral Commission and will ensure that the Bill and PPERA operate together and that campaigning is fair and transparent On designation and the time allowed for the campaign we have proposed changes which I hope will please my hon Friend the Member for Stone Sir William Cash  as they address concerns he raised with me in Committee and again this evening He was worried that we should have a full 16 week campaign and that designation should not eat into the final 10 week short campaign period I promised him that we would find an answer to make sure that it did not These changes mean that the required statutory instrument to fix the date for the referendum should as is usual for an affirmative resolution take six weeks to go through the House Only once that process is complete does the 10 week short campaign period start Obviously six plus 10 equals 16 I hope that my hon Friend and others will be reassured that we will have adequate time to debate during that entire 16 week period Equally it is important that the designation process means that the decision on who are the lead campaign groups for the in and the out campaigns is properly arrived at that and those groups are clearly designated before the start of the 10 week campaign since that will allow them to access the money that designation as lead campaign groups allows and also to spend that money correctly to put their points as strongly as possible during the last 10 weeks of the campaign We have therefore decided to table an amendment that will allow the designation process to be done via a negative resolution and if necessary for that resolution to take effect immediately on the day at the latest that the SI setting the date for the referendum is tabled That will mean that while the SI setting the date is going through Parliament the work by the Electoral Commission to designate lead campaign groups can be going on in parallel and will be complete on or before the start of the 10 week period so that designation will be complete in time for the full 10 weeks to be carried out properly I hope that that answers very briefly the major concerns that were raised in Committee and again here today I should also mention that the negative resolution I have described would need to take effect very promptly on the day that it was tabled That is unusual we usually wait for two to three weeks after tabling something before it takes effect I have already spoken to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments to discuss the importance and exceptionality of getting the provision to take effect immediately rather than after three weeks I look forward to working with him on this wherever possible I now move on to some of the non Government amendments Amendment 1 in the name of my hon Friend the Member for Stone would require that the referendum period be no shorter than 16 weeks I hope we have already dealt with that and therefore do not propose to dwell on it any more strongly Amendment 3 also in the name of my hon Friend would require that the legislation be clear at least six months before it is required to be implemented or complied with I think that his rationale is based on the Electoral Commission recommendation that the rules be clear six months before they are enforced We can satisfy that recommendation in a slightly brisker and less onerous fashion because we have already published the detailed draft regulations on how the vote should be held They have been available in the Commons Library since July and the Electoral Commission has been assessing them carefully too The rules will already have been extremely clear for six months by spring next year and I hope that that will give everybody plenty of chance to consider and absorb the details and subtleties as needed I hope that my hon Friend will therefore be able to withdraw his amendment New clause 11 deals with spending caps which were mentioned by a number of colleagues The new clause would mean that all political parties seeking to campaign in the referendum would not be able to spend in total more than 14 million This would replace the individual spending limit set for political parties that register as permitted participants under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000 I think that my hon Friend the Member for Stone is seeking to reduce the impact that political parties presumably the major ones can have in campaigning in the referendum but I am afraid that the new clause would not necessarily achieve what he may intend For example assuming that the 11 parties had secured between them 99 of the general election vote the Lib Dems and the UK Independence party would find that their spending limit fell by between 55 and 60 compared with the levels currently set in PPERA and the Greens Plaid Cymru and the Democratic Unionist party would find their allocations falling by over 90  Instead of 700 000 each Plaid Cymru for example would be stuck with a limit of 84 000 If political parties wanted to get round my hon Friend s proposal they could simply register several other permitted participants and funnel any extra money that they might have into them Their total spending would be well above the limit that he suggests and the new clause would not be able to stop it It also opens up the option for political game playing whereby parties may not want to campaign but simply register to impact on and reduce the limits of other political rivals That would not reflect well on the quality of rules underpinning the referendum I therefore hope that he will be able to withdraw the new clause I hope that I can reassure my hon Friends in relation to the various amendments on the European Commission s role For a start neither EU institutions nor foreign Governments are legally permitted donors under UK election law so any campaign group that took money from them would be committing an offence I note that the Electoral Commission announced on Friday that it does not support the amendments for that reason There are well tested rules modelled on election rules to prevent anyone from circumventing that by using middlemen Equally to take an example entirely at random if my hon Friends are considering supporting the out campaign I gently suggest that any attempt by the EU to interfere in the campaign would be a huge boost to my hon Friends side and although the EU is many things it is not stupid so I suspect that it already understands that point Time is very tight but I propose to speak very briefly about the changes proposed to broadcasters impartiality I simply say that the existing regulators already have many of the required powers the question is about turning principle into practice and getting them to use those powers I am delighted to confirm that my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport has urged them to do so I therefore hope that we will not need to add any further regulators to the panoply that already exists I will sit down to leave the hon Member for Ilford South Mike Gapes  who moved the lead amendment a few moments to round off the debate,07/09/2015,2391,England,positive
2015-2017,robertson,angus,09/09/2015,external relations,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Scottish National Party,469,I beg to move That this House recognises the funding the Government has committed to the humanitarian initiatives to provide sanctuary in camps for refugees across the Middle East calls for a greater international effort through the United Nations to secure the position of such displaced people recognises that the Government has committed to accepting 20 000 vulnerable people from camps in Syria over the next five years but calls for a Government report to be laid before the House by 12 October 2015 detailing how that number can be increased encompassing refugees already in Europe and including a plan for the remainder of this year to reflect the overwhelming urgency of this humanitarian crisis further notes that refugees arriving in European Union territory also have a moral and legal right to be treated properly and given the pressure on Southern European countries further calls for the UK to play its full and proper role in conjunction with European partners in providing sanctuary to our fellow human beings I am grateful to have the opportunity to move this cross party motion in today s Scottish National party Opposition day debate I urge all Members to look very closely at the Order Paper I know that that does not always happen to read the text of the motion and to note a very unusual sight The motion is co sponsored by the leaders of six parliamentary parties the Scottish National party the Labour party the Liberal Democrats Plaid Cymru the Green party the Social Democratic and Labour party as well as the independent Unionist MP the hon Member for North Down Lady Hermon  Although I welcome the Secretary of State for International Development and her Government colleagues to the Treasury Bench I am disappointed given the cross party nature of the motion and the seriousness of the subject that the Prime Minister is not here I am sure that many people who care passionately about the need to do as much as we can in this humanitarian crisis will be saddened that he did not think it important enough to attend today s debate That stands in sharp contrast to the all party approach that we saw last week in Scotland which included the leader of the Conservative party in the Scottish Parliament That cross party approach to making plans was chaired by the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and included charities and others I do not want to dwell on that discordant point because I would prefer Members particularly Government Members to look closely at the text of the motion Perhaps unusually on an Opposition day the motion is not aimed at identifying or highlighting shortcomings in the Government s policy Given the gravity of the humanitarian situation and the fast moving nature of developments in recent days we who have sponsored the motion have worked hard in formulating a text to recognise what is being proposed which we all welcome and to encourage what must happen next On Monday we had a significant update of UK policy by the Prime Minister with commitments made to help many more people and we welcome that The scale of the humanitarian crisis is immense Millions of people have been displaced from the conflict in Syria to neighbours such as Lebanon and Jordan Many of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been on the move are from other war torn and oppressive countries Today the European Commission has outlined its immediate plans to deal with the situation and that does not come before time We are told that it is the time for bold action by EU member states and institutions I note the words EU member states not just some of them all of us and that includes the United Kingdom For the world it is a matter of humanity and human dignity For Europe it is a matter for historical fairness Europe is a continent where people from nearly all countries at some point have been refugees at one time fleeing war dictatorship or oppression There is a fundamental right to asylum It is one of the most important international values and we should not forget that We should be proud of the fact that Europe is seen as a safe haven for those who are fleeing horrific circumstances We should not fear this we should be proud of it It is true that Europe cannot house all the misery of the world we know that but we must put things into perspective How can it be that we are hearing from all sides and justifiably so that we should do everything to combat an insidious terrorist movement such as Daesh but we are not prepared to accept those people who are fleeing from it In the Mediterranean as the European Commission pointed out today every life lost is one too many regardless of where those people are trying to get to We know that efforts have been redoubled to dismantle human trafficking groups We learn that fewer boats are under the control of smugglers on the perilous route That is a good thing We must applaud the efforts of countries such as Jordan Turkey and Lebanon Those countries which are far poorer than we are are making huge efforts in moral and financial terms We must recognise however that we we the United Kingdom we Europe have clearly under delivered in the common solidarity we have offered to refugees who have arrived on our territory Italy Hungary and Greece alone cannot be left to deal with this enormous challenge This is not a defining matter of whether or not one is within the Schengen zone,09/09/2015,2516,Scotland,negative

2015-2017,hinds,damian,27/10/2015,welfare and quality of life,0,46,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Conservative,231,I can only guess that the hon Lady is making a strange reference to the Conservative manifesto We were very clear in our manifesto that we are still only halfway through the job of getting the deficit down to zero It stands at 3 300 for every household in the United Kingdom and we said very clearly during the election campaign that as part of that we needed to make 12 billion of welfare savings What was not in our manifesto was the national living wage The Chancellor has said that he has listened to concerns from colleagues in this House and will come forward with proposals in the autumn statement to achieve the goal of reforming tax credits saving the money needed to secure our economy while helping with the transition through the changes I do not believe that the new clauses are therefore appropriate for inclusion in the Bill I now turn to amendments 49 to 52 which intend to prevent the freeze for four years of working age benefits child benefit and tax credits The freeze of the main rates of the majority of working age benefits child benefit and tax credits will in total contribute some 3 5 billion of savings by 2019 20 and will help us to achieve our objective of deficit elimination It will put welfare on a fairer and more sustainable footing so that we can continue our investment in our national health service and our schools even as we get the national finances back into balance As my hon Friend the Member for Fareham Suella Fernandes pointed out there is an imbalance in a system that has seen a rise in average earnings of 12 since 2008 and in working age benefits such as jobseekers allowance of 21  The individual element of child tax credit has risen by 33  The freeze will help reverse that trend helping earnings to grow faster than benefits which will strengthen the incentives to work and deliver the savings necessary to bring down the overall welfare bill None the less the Government will continue to offer protections to the most vulnerable We know the best way to support people is to help them move closer to the labour market but of course we realise that that is not possible for everyone That is why we have made many important exemptions to the four year freeze We have exempted pensioner related benefits personal independence payment disability allowance and attendance allowance relating to the additional cost of disability as well as statutory payments carers allowance the support group component of the employment and support allowance and disability elements in tax credits,27/10/2015,3905,England,positive
2015-2017,davies,philip,30/10/2015,welfare and quality of life,0,43,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,Conservative,595,I was about to come on to that point and my hon Friend makes it very well One of the essential reasons for hospitals charging is that particularly near town centres people use the free parking and then go and spend all day at work That does not help any carer who is trying to find a parking space That is why it is so important that hospitals have to be able to use charges in a way that suits their particular local circumstances to ensure that visitor and staff parking is always available when it is needed Without their being able to make some restrictions on a local basis there will be nothing to prevent people from using the site as a free car parking area I have no idea perhaps the hon Member for Burnley could tell me whether parking would be free for carers only when they are coming to the hospital as a carer or free for them all the time because they are a carer That is not clear in the Bill I am looking for assistance from some of my more learned colleagues but it appears that nobody knows the answer to that question including the promoter of the Bill so I will leave it there as something that does not seem to have been thought through This does not apply only to hospitals close to town centres as mentioned by my hon Friend the Member for Solihull Julian Knight  but to those that are close to railway stations where there is also a large demand for parking My hon Friend the Member for Christchurch Mr Chope mentioned Scotland earlier This issue has arisen at hospitals in Wales and Scotland since they scrapped car parking charges The NHS Confederation said  The NHS Confederation represents 99 per cent of NHS trusts in England On behalf of our members we support the right for NHS trusts to determine their own car parking and transport arrangements within current regulations and good practice  That is what is under threat today A response from the House of Commons Library states  There is nothing specifically stopping hospitals from giving concessions or free parking to carers or other groups although all public bodies need to operate within the framework of the Equalities Act i e avoid discrimination against protected groups Decisions on hospital car parking charges are a matter for the NHS body running the car park  Hospitals clearly have the flexibility to offer a free parking policy for carers as the hon Member for Burnley said some have already done so but it is not right that we as a House should force them to do so Hospitals that do not already have a free car parking policy for carers have clearly assessed the situation and chosen not to for whatever reasons There may well be good reasons that we are better not second guessing If she feels so strongly about this issue perhaps her time would be better spent lobbying her own hospital trust in Burnley to persuade it of the argument for giving carers free parking as opposed to coming along here and trying to impose it everywhere else when she has not even persuaded her own hospital in Burnley to do it Hospital parking charges are a key part of income generation Hospitals may choose not to give free parking because car parking on healthcare sites is an income generation scheme under the income generation powers that enable NHS bodies to raise additional income for their health services NHS bodies are allowed to charge for car parking and to raise revenue from it as an income generating activity as long as certain rules are followed Income generation activities must not interfere to a significant degree with the provision of NHS core services It is also crucial to note that these income generation schemes must be profitable because it would be unacceptable for moneys provided for the benefit of NHS patients to be used to support other commercial activities It has to be the other way round the commercial activity has to support the core NHS services The profit made by income generation schemes has to be used to improve health services That is absolutely crucial The money has to go towards that particular purpose The Department of Health s National Health Service Income Generation Best Practice Revised Guidance on Income Generation in the NHS  which was published in February 2006 clearly sets out that income generation must be profitable Paragraph 30 10 states  For a scheme to be classed as an Income Generation scheme the following conditions need to be met the scheme must be profitable and provide a level of income that exceeds total costs  It then goes on at great length but that is the key part so I will not bore everybody by reading the whole paragraph The document goes on to say that the profit made from the scheme which the NHS body would keep must be used for improving the health services  and the goods or services must be marketed outside the NHS Those being provided for statutory or public policy reasons are not income generation  Therefore if exemptions are made for other people that must be taken into consideration when calculating the estimated annual revenue and whether it will make a profit or a loss I fear that if the hon Lady s Bill is successful the consequence will be not just exemptions for carers worthy sentiment though that may be but I suspect higher car parking charges for everybody else who visits the hospital so that it can protect its revenue stream The hon Lady did not mention that and she has not been open about it but the chances are that that will be the consequence of the Bill Everyone else will have to pay more in order to meet the NHS s criteria for income generation That means that all of the people the Government think should get a concession from car parking charges including people with disabilities and those who visit hospital regularly will not be exempt but will have to pay more as a consequence of this Bill Does the hon Lady really want to tell all disabled patients who go to hospital that in order to pay for her Bill they are going to have to pay more to park at their local hospital If that is the message she wants to send I think she is rather brave I would not want to tell my disabled constituents that they are going to have to pay more It seems to me that that would be an inevitable consequence of the Bill That is why we cannot pass legislation based on a worthy sentiment we have to think through the consequences  Interruption  If the hon Member for Birmingham Perry Barr Mr Mahmood wants to intervene I would be

2015-2017,allen,graham,17/11/2015,political system,0,62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Labour,925,I want to talk about the very broad amendments that I have tabled New clause 29 and new schedule 2 get to the heart of the debate that is we can have all the powers you like but if we do not have the financial capability to use them effectively they are an empty charade We are accompanied in this Chamber by people of great expertise with at least three former leaders of councils and other colleagues who have great experience on local authorities The hon Member for Bromley and Chislehurst Robert Neill my hon Friend if I may call him that has great experience that he put to the service of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee in the previous Parliament He enhanced our reports particularly where they touched on local government There is great expertise in the Chamber and I defy anyone to counter the truism that without finance powers are useless That is why I return again to the question of what happens next on devolution This Bill is absolutely essential The Minister has heard me say on many occasions that it is a good Bill that makes good progress but he has also heard me ask on many occasions  What comes next Once the foundations are in what do we do to build a more secure construction on them  If the Minister does not intend to accept my new clauses I ask him to look to the future and to consider how we can expand the financial capability of local government We can do that in a number of areas Indeed my Select Committee in the last Parliament inspired me to draft the Local Government Independence Bill which is available from all good Vote Offices or even from me should anyone who is viewing the debate care to read it It laid out a number of areas where we could use existing precedent to free local government in England and enable proper devolution One of the key precedents was and is Scotland The efforts of Donald Dewar the Scottish citizens convention the coalition s Scotland Act 2012 and the cross party consensus among those of us who do not wish to split up the Union and who support the current Scotland Bill which delivers on the promise that was made before the Scottish referendum have all contributed to enhancing the capability of the Scottish Parliament to raise and retain its own income What is good enough for Scotland is good enough for England England would need a different mechanism to deliver the heart of the deal which is income tax assignment but it is not beyond the wit of mankind to create that capability Drawing on the lessons of the Scottish experience we could soon get to a position where income tax assignment channelled through the Department for Communities and Local Government filtered down into a clear honest and accountable amount of income tax without having to make any changes to the rates the method of collection or equalisation That would provide local people with transparency and clarity with regard to where and when their income tax is spent via central Government by local councils and local authorities That would be a significant step forward just as the Scotland Act 2012 was for the Scottish people On equalisation many people get anxious about income tax assignment and say  That means you re retaining the income tax raised in your locality  but that is not what it means As happens now income tax would go to the centre and it would be reallocated through the existing formula or a slightly changed formula depending on the consensus at the time Equalisation would stay exactly the same as it is now unless all players including above all local government perhaps represented by the Local Government Association consented to any change The Local Government Independence Bill was the product of a lot of thinking involving academics Queen s counsel the Public Bill Office and this House to try to make sure that everything was defined as accurately as possible so that it could be legislated on It outlines ways in which local government could raise additional income but with the very strong caveat that it could not use any additional sources of income unless it involved local people in the decision and they agreed to them The issue has been discussed before on the Floor of the House and we raised the obvious example of charging a hotel tax or bed tax as it is sometimes called if local people consent to it The heart of devolution is represented not by the Government saying  Everybody should do this  but by the freedom of local areas to try if they wish to get the consent of people in their locality Members have touched repeatedly on the idea that that approach will be so much stronger if it is done voluntarily Rather than looking for ways to get out of a straitjacket people will be seeking means to join the club of local authorities that can raise money in particular ways They would learn from each other from the experience of colleagues down the road or from further afield and perhaps as I have suggested in new clauses from a best practice centre of some description owned by local authorities contributed to by central Government to take devolution to the next step Let us look at some of the good things that have happened although not everywhere and offer them to other authorities so that they can if they wish move forward I will not repeat the arguments but I want briefly to raise another matter The Local Government Independence Bill proposed that local government s ability to raise bonds or loans should be much clearer to ordinary people We heard earlier about transport issues If someone wished to raise a bond on the local government bond market which is a multi trillion dollar market in America they could use their credit rating people are more likely to be willing to take a risk on local government than on central Government to raise bonds or loans I argue very strongly that should happen once there has been a debate with local people not because someone in a closed finance committee or the mayor and his or her deputy made a decision in a smoke filled room People should be involved so that we can ensure they have signed up to raising bonds to create a dozen children s centres an early intervention programme or whatever it may be and so that they will watch such a project and take pride in its success as people who do in so many civic arenas The people in Nottingham are very proud of their tram system and their workplace parking levy that raises money for all sorts of transport projects in our city Every Member of the House could reel off examples of their own That is at the heart of the new clauses I have tabled but there is one last and very significant bottom line We have so often seen central Government offer local government baubles or a few extra crumbs on this that or the other but when it suits central Government of all parties they take back what they had recently given away If devolution is to mean anything it has to be sustainable It cannot be that if a Secretary of State does not like something an authority is doing for example re establishing grammar schools they can say  I don t like that I m going to take back that power  No the Secretary of State must win the argument about schooling The same would apply if a local authority had ownership of the Work programme and everything to do with tackling employment but the Secretary of State said  No I don t think they re doing it right I wouldn t do it like that and sought to take back such powers If devolution is to mean anything it must be permanent and entrenched If it is entrenched people can get on with it build and have some certainty At our disposal we have number of weapons to entrench a proper settlement for English devolution We can give local government independence and then protect that behind the Parliament Act 1911 so that any attempt to veto or to suck back powers can be refused by the second Chamber or perhaps the device of a super majority it defends our right always to have a fixed term Parliament of five years could be used to defend the rights of local government Without that protection such powers are favours not rights Finally I want to touch on a minor but important issue tabled as my new clause 33 that has been raised with me by the National Association of Local Councils who represent town and parish councils I hope that the Minister will reassure me on this point which relates to local energy production In Germany local energy that comes from renewable sources accounts for 46 of all renewable energy In the UK it accounts for less than 1 0 3 is produced by our localities That is an appalling record in anybody s book I hope that we can liberate our parish and town councils and those who currently cannot sell their electricity that is made by renewables That would do everybody a favour Currently Cambourne parish council is inhibited in doing what it would like to do This relatively minor change could see the development of cost effective solar panelling on school and community centre roofs I will not press new clause 33 to a vote and if the Minister is not prepared to respond to it today I would be most grateful if he wrote to me It was put to me in a spirit of consensus by the National Association of Local Councils I will finish with one small example of how energy impinges on what we are talking about today I have talked of boasting about civic pride and it is a matter of pride that Nottingham City Council has launched Robin Hood Energy Every domestic consumer can apply to that not for profit organisation and get the best tariff from all the existing suppliers That has been done in an era of massive constraint on local government Just imagine what local government could do if it was free to be sensitive to what the delivery of local energy could mean both at the district and county level and as under new clause 33 at the parish and town council level I will not ask the Committee to vote on the new clauses I have tabled I have put them down as a marker If the Minister wants to take forward the debate about what will come next in the English devolution arena I will send him my personal copy of the Local Government Independence Bill signed or unsigned whatever he prefers to give him ideas that might find the

2015-2017,rees-mogg,jacob,14/12/2015,external relations,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,590,I am actually going to support the Government today too There seem to be amazing levels of support which is always quite dangerous but it is refreshing that the Scottish National party is here in force to ensure that these matters are properly debated and scrutiny is carried out effectively The reason I support the Government is partly because the European Union has made an absolute hash of it I phrase myself slightly more bluntly than the hon and learned Member for Holborn and St Pancras Keir Starmer who in glorious understatement said that the scheme of the European Union was not working as anticipated Well I thought that was on a par with the late Emperor of Japan who at the end of the war said  The war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan s advantage  When we think that according to the Daily Express 184 people out of 160 000 have been relocated it is a failure even by the terms of the European Union It introduced a plan that was hotly opposed by elected Governments It imposed it by qualified majority voting We fortunately had an opt out which we used But what underlies this policy is to my mind also so wrong Here I disagree with the hon Member for Glenrothes Peter Grant  who made a very powerful speech about the duty we have to mankind in general I very much accept that The duty to refugees is fundamental It is tremendously important and is something the United Kingdom has done for centuries The question then is how to do it well how to do it effectively and how to preserve life so that we actually save people It seems to me that what the European Union has done has made the situation worse for the refugees themselves Of over 900 000 who have come by boat to the shores of the European Union in 2015 3 671 have either died or gone missing The terrible events in the Mediterranean in 2014 led the Holy Father to say  We cannot allow the Mediterranean to become a vast graveyard  The reason this happened is the pious but failed hopes of the European Union s refugee policy the idea that as soon as people get into the boundaries of the European Union they will get citizenship but if they cannot get here there is nothing that will be done for them That seems to me to encourage people to take these crazy risks that have led to the tragedies The EU s policy is itself creating dangers for refugees The refugees who come are not the halt and the lame but the fittest and the most able to take the risks involved in trying to cross the sea to come to the European Union We have seen that 70 of the refugees who have come to the European Union are in fact men primarily young men A system has been set up that creates incentives and leads people to take foolish risks to come here in the first place The people who are most at risk the children the elderly and the frail are left behind because if they apply from their risky country the forces of the EU will not let them in Her Majesty s Government have got this right but the numbers are hopeless The 20 000 over five years is absolutely a step in the right direction but of course we should do more We should think of how many we take from the European Union under the free movement of people In the year to March 2015 we took 183 000 economic migrants from the European Union 183 000 people who were safe in their own country and not at risk of persecution They were not in fear of their lives They wanted to come here for the most noble and honourable reason to improve the condition of themselves and their families They moved halfway across a continent to do it and that is something I admire hugely That is a very Conservative thing to do to wish to better oneself and to take that risk That is what entrepreneurs do However they are economic migrants not refugees And because we take so many people from the European Union under the guise of the free movement of people when it comes to taking those who are genuinely at risk of their life we take 4 000 a year We take 4 000 a year from the camps in Syria who may die if they do not escape and we take 183 000 because we believe in the principle of European citizenship and that anyone who wants to come here from the EU should be free to waltz in wherever they have waltzed from This is not only undesirable in domestic political terms it is undesirable in moral terms We are not helping those who are most in need we are helping those who do not in fact need our help and support We are helping those who are safe rather than being generous to those who are at risk This seems to me a fundamental failing of the European Union because instead of giving aid to refugees it encourages people to take unwarranted risks and gives benefits to those who are already safe Why do I stick to this number of 183 000 and what is the context The context is that there is a limit to the numbers any country will take in any one year not because free movement is a bad thing in itself but because the societies to which people move cannot cope with the influx above a certain level There is not the infrastructure there are not the schools or hospitals and the society lacks the capacity to absorb large numbers at one point Their arrival needs to be staggered over a much longer period If we have so many coming from safe countries inevitably we have to be mean with the numbers we can control because they do not benefit from the European treaties and free movement with the EU The EU s whole approach is wrong and we in our renegotiation are unutterably feeble all we are doing is muddling about with a few benefits which is not why people come anyway As I said earlier they come for that noble inspirational reason they want to improve their lives and those of their families They do not come because they are benefits cheats yet we grub around on that rather than thinking about the real problem the scale of immigration from the EU As the hon Member for Luton North Kelvin Hopkins pointed out free for all immigration does not work for our democracy Our people our voters our electors do not want it they reject it and yet the Government do not even ask to get this back under domestic control Instead they do not opt in to one part of things with many parts but it will not have any great effect I will support the Government tonight but what was the best reason we heard for why the 800 000 Mrs Merkel is welcoming in will not come here Apparently our ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Germany has reported to Ministers that we do not need to worry about them coming here because the Germans are slow at processing citizenship applications Well isn t that lucky They are slow I always thought German bureaucracy was efficient but clearly not when it comes to processing citizenship applications they might take 10 years So we will not get 800 000 today or tomorrow But we will get them the election after next That I am afraid is where the Government are failing and letting down the British people They have opted out of one thing but they have left the big the real the major problem

question why we are not in the same party because every time she speaks I find myself agreeing wholeheartedly with her on a variety of different issues The hon Lady will not know that in my maiden speech in 2010 to some colleagues surprise I spoke about the UK space industry In fact I was advised by some wise owls in these parts that I should not speak about the space industry because I would be ridiculed as the spaceman of the House of Commons A year or so later I secured an Adjournment debate in this Chamber in which I discussed the rather esoteric subject of microgravity During my speech I spoke about the value of protein crystal investigation the potential for doing a variety of biotechnological and medical experiments in space and how that could advance our knowledge base Major Tim Peake is doing all those experiments now I like to think that that Adjournment debate led in part to the Government s decision to invest in the European Space Agency s European Programme for Life and Physical Sciences That investment led to Tim Peake whose field of expertise is microgravity travelling on the rocket to the international space station The space industry has hardly any presence in my constituency so why did I decide to talk about it in my maiden speech in 2010 and why did I subsequently take up the House s time to talk about microgravity in an Adjournment debate It was because as the hon Member for Central Ayrshire has already eloquently pointed out there is something about space and the exploration thereof particularly manned exploration and flights that is truly inspirational to everybody Whenever I visit schools during their science technology engineering and maths week invariably I see pictures there of planets and rockets There is something about space and the exploration of it that inspires young people When engineers were asked why they had done an engineering degree at university up to 40 of them said that they had done so because of the exploration of space and that their interest had first been stimulated by images from space I made my maiden speech in an Opposition day debate on industry I thought it was important to talk about the space industry not only because I think that the future of this great country is wedded to the success of science and technology and that that will increasingly become the case but because the space industry is in and of itself so inspirational and such a great success that it needs as much support as possible from Governments of whichever colour The previous Labour Government did some very good work and UK space policy made some significant advances as a result I hope and expect that this Government will follow suit When I made my maiden speech the estimated size of the space industry was 6 8 billion but the figure now is 11 6 billion That increase has happened in five or six years The space industry has grown so successfully during that time that we would struggle without the tangible value it provides I have been vice chairman of the parliamentary space committee pretty much ever since I made my maiden speech and I have often experienced pushback when I talk about the value of manned space flights As the hon Lady has said there is a sense that somehow space is for others not for Britain that the exploration of space is very expensive and that we should be concentrating on other things However let us remember that for every dollar the US Government spent on the Apollo space programme there was a remarkable 13 dollar return on their investment The returns were not just financial In December 1968 a very famous photograph was taken by Bill Anders on Apollo 8 the so called Earthrise photograph The value of that photograph cannot be calculated in financial terms alone Imagine where the environmental lobby would be if it did not have a photograph of the earth as seen from the moon Imagine how those astronauts felt when they put up a hand and hid the earth with their thumb Our perception of this wonderful planet was changed by that investment by the US Government Of course it was driven by a race with the Soviet Union but the return was not just financial We recognised the fragility of this planet and how fortunate we are I would argue that in the process of the achievement of putting the first man on the moon in July 1969 man rediscovered the value of exploration Now we face the next challenge which is to place a person on the surface of Mars perhaps it should be a woman Increasingly women are deployed in fighter jets because of their ability to withstand G force so perhaps it will be a woman who first stands on Mars I think that Britain should be part of that The cost may seem large but we should consider it in proportion to the rest of the money we spend as a nation and indeed as a world If we are not prepared to explore space push back our boundaries of knowledge and discover things that we did not realise we were going to discover then what on earth are we about as a species Space is an exciting subject and I cannot think of another subject that is so truly inspirational British Governments of whichever colour should play a greater part in it and recognise that they have a role to play in mitigating risk and that private investment alone will not bring it about If we do that this country will have a very bright future

2015-2017,elliott,julie,18/01/2016,economy,1,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Labour,484,I totally agree with that The impact on the solar energy businesses in this country has been dramatic Let me give a specific example which is relevant to my constituents in Sunderland and also speaks to the way in which this Government s policies have suffocated the growth in clean energy generation and the jobs that go with it Nissan in Sunderland recently wrote to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change regarding a 3 million investment it wished to make in extending a wind farm on its site a letter to which I understand Nissan has not yet received a reply The aim of the project is to generate more and cleaner energy on site so that less needs to be procured from outside But the Government s 18 June announcement on the renewables obligation and onshore wind has placed this development in serious jeopardy Under current proposals Nissan s investment will not go ahead because it had not secured planning permission or a grid connection agreement by the time of the announcement Nissan has been working with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and had an application for exceptional regional growth fund money accepted However a condition of this funding is that work cannot commence on a project such as planning applications or grid connection negotiations until the support application has been determined In Nissan s own words it finds itself in a Catch 22 position under the terms of the regional growth fund it is unable to seek the necessary approvals before the cut off date and the continuation of the exceptional regional growth fund programme was not confirmed until after the 2015 general election The business case and regional growth fund application were based on eligibility under the renewables obligation Without this the development cannot go ahead My hon Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West Mrs Hodgson  in whose constituency the Nissan plant is based raised this matter at Prime Minister s questions last week The Prime Minister answered in general terms and did not address the specific point yet this is the sort of project the Government should be encouraging not suffocating The fact that that project which is on a brownfield site for a major company that wants to reduce its carbon footprint enhance the UK s energy security and support an onshore wind industry that now employs 19 000 people may now not go ahead should be evidence of a policy that is not serving the best interests of this country I ask the Secretary of State to engage with Nissan at the earliest possible opportunity if she has not already done so so that a sensible outcome can be achieved It is such confused and counterproductive policy making that many find so frustrating The independent Committee on Climate Change has stated that the Government policy has created a stop start investment profile which has hindered cost reduction and industry development This has been compounded by retrospective changes like the one to the renewables obligation in this Bill It therefore comes as no surprise that the UK has fallen down the global league tables for energy investment EY s respected global rankings show that under this Government the UK has fallen from fourth in the world in November 2013 to 11th EY singled out the UK Government for a lack of clarity and death by a thousand cuts  with misguided short term politics obstructing long term policy    in a vacuum with no rationale or clear intent  What does that vacuum look like in real terms It looks like cheap clean onshore wind and solar subsidies being cut while developers are being incentivised to install diesel generators second only to coal in carbon intensity on their sites One thousand such generators have been installed in the past 18 months because current Government policy has led to such narrow margins this winter This was not what energy policy should lead to in the second decade of the 21st century That vacuum looks like UK solar capacity falling 30 year on year in 2015 despite a global upward trend It looks like clean energy developers losing their exemption from the climate change levy It looks like the abolition of the zero carbon homes standard and the green deal being axed due to uncompetitive high interest rates It looks like mothballing carbon capture and storage in the UK despite the knowledge of the fact CCS is not an option but a necessity for decarbonisation particularly for energy intensive industries It looks like pernicious planning interventions with claims that power is being devolved to local communities followed as we saw in the previous Parliament by unprecedented intervention from Whitehall by the right hon Member for Brentwood and Ongar Sir Eric Pickles  I hope the Secretary of State will look again at the proposal from Nissan and at what it is doing more generally in relation to clean energy No one has a monopoly on wisdom but in the face of opposition from clean energy developers with the Government s own independent Committee on Climate Change detailing its fears when global consultancies show the

the detail of the questions and concerns that have been raised As I have done in previous debates I assure hon Members that I will write to them to give them my best answer This debate short though it is I join others in saying that we should have longer debates has shown that there is interest concern and expertise in this House I pay tribute to the hon Member for East Renfrewshire Kirsten Oswald for securing this important debate As many hon Members did she started by talking about the humanitarian devastation in Yemen and said this was the forgotten war I had the opportunity at the current conference on Syria to speak to the UN Secretary General Ban Ki moon I said  Look at the support that Martin Kobler is given in Libya and that Staffan de Mistura is given in dealing with the Geneva talks and compare that with the support given to Ismail Ahmed the UN special envoy for Yemen They are not on the same scale  There is an acknowledgement that more needs to be done by the international community because of the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe taking place there The hon Lady also mentioned concerns about oil and other assets needed to keep people alive getting into the country as did others She said that the UK is looking the other way but as we have heard in passionate speeches from Members on both sides of the House Britain certainly is not looking the other way We are one of the largest donors and supporters of the country We are working to support the UN envoy and we are working towards a political solution She touched on the 119 incidents mentioned by the UN report and I intervened on her to qualify my own comments The Opposition spokesman whom I welcome to his place asked me about that I did raise the issue with the Saudi representatives at the Syria conference and I also spoke to President Hadi on the phone today raising the concerns about what is happening in Yemen I also had the opportunity to speak to the UN envoy to raise the concerns about the scale and profile of what is happening I am sorry that there has been a delay in the talks following the ceasefire that took place in December and we are working hard to establish what needs to come first before the ceasefire I am referring to the confidence building measures which are the prelude to then making sure that the ceasefire can last My hon Friend the Member for Charnwood Edward Argar gave a passionate speech again calling this the forgotten war and talking about Yemen being a complex and ancient land He also commended the role DFID is playing and our contributions there and I concur with him on that The right hon Member for Leicester East Keith Vaz articulated his own experience of Yemen Indeed there are others in the House who have lived in or who were born in that country as well I am grateful to the right hon Gentleman for his kind words of support He touched on the wider concerns of extremism in the Arab peninsula not least with al Qaeda which was responsible for a number of attacks on the mainland and he made an important link between what is happening in the region and the security that we have in our own country as well and that should not be forgotten The day before yesterday I met the culture Minister of Oman and raised some of those concerns with him It was a private meeting but it was very helpful to have such a frank conversation My hon Friend the Member for Torbay Kevin Foster stepped back and looked at the wider regional picture He reminded the House that from a maritime perspective Yemen is one of the seven global pinch points in the world He also talked about the threat from other extremist organisations such as Daesh which recently killed the governor of Aden Indeed al Qaeda runs the town of Mukalla which is a port town on the southern coast He also mentioned the effect of change by asking what would happen if the Administration in Saudi Arabia were changed It is a liberal wing that is running that very conservative country Of course we want change and modernisation but it must be done at a workable pace Let me turn now to my friend the hon Member for Liverpool West Derby Stephen Twigg  whom I have known for a couple of decades we used to represent different student unions at university It was a pleasure to stand in front of the International Development Committee of which he is Chairman I offer on record to meet him in private to talk about some of the detail as I appreciate that he and his Committee members were a little frustrated in my not being able to answer all their questions He talked about the city of Taiz Sadly President Hadi has confirmed that the city has again been cut off and that humanitarian aid cannot get in The hon Gentleman again raised the matter of the report of the UN expert panel I can confirm that we are looking into its findings but there is a UN process as well which was pre empted when the report was leaked None the less there is a process and we will be following it and looking at the findings The hon Gentleman talked about the formation of the Committees on Arms Export Control It is absolutely fantastic Why has it taken so long It is an important aspect from a legislative perspective of holding the Executive to account I am pleased to see that it is to be reformed He also touched on the Human Rights Council resolution in October There is a consensus there and he will be aware of that As much as any individual would want to push forward a particular line we have to leave the room with what will actually work and it was decided that the resolution would work I should make it clear that the council then determined that it would provide assistance to Yemen s national independent commission of inquiry which will look into the details It will then report back to the Human Rights Council If it is felt that the inquiry is not independent enough then that is the vehicle that can be used for that to be recognised rather than having a general call for an independent inquiry Time is against me I have so many other comments to make and answers to provide As I have said I will write to Members with my response to this debate I can say that this Government take what is happening in Yemen very seriously I personally have devoted an awful lot of time trying to remain at the forefront so that I have some influence I recognise the concern that this House has over the human rights issues and I will take them away with me I am grateful that we have had this opportunity to debate these matters I certainly hope that the next time we do so we

2015-2017,vaz,valerie,28/04/2016,political system,1,62,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Labour,552,Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker I assume that that was an intervention so I will get an extra minute I thank the hon Member for Glasgow South West Chris Stephens for securing this Backbench Business debate and of course the Backbench Business Committee This is an important debate The Government can raise money in three ways create it borrow it or raise taxes The main purpose of HMRC the subject of the debate is to collect taxes That enables the Government to take back what they have spent on public services I want to focus on whether HMRC works where it is going and what can be done to change it to make it more accountable The governance arrangements are quite bizarre for a democracy Given HMRC s importance in collecting taxes the fact that it is a non ministerial Department is incongruous There is no Minister to hold to account on behalf of the people for whom it ostensibly works It is governed by a board on which four out of five non execs are from big business There is no representation from pay as you earn taxpayers of which there are 31 million or even from small businesses There appears to be no accountability and no acting in the public interest That needs to change From the Occupy movement at St Paul s in 2011 to the Panama papers the public are becoming more aware of what happens to the tax people pay or in fact do not pay They are becoming more aware of the fact that after a few lunches large corporations can get the light touch treatment Google paid the equivalent of 3 in corporation tax In 2011 Starbucks paid no corporation tax Mr Deputy Speaker I do not know whether you know the joke about people who wanted to raise awareness about the fact that Starbucks was not paying tax They would go in ask for a coffee and say that their name was no tax  so that the barista who came back with their coffee would call out  Coffee for no tax  That has had a huge effect on making people aware that Starbucks was not paying any money It has been pointed out by the International Business Times that Shell British American Tobacco Lloyds banking group and Vodafone all paid nothing in corporation tax You will remember Mr Deputy Speaker that the former head David Hartnett had 10 lunches with KPMG and it had its tax liability reduced It even has a non executive representative on the board Where is HMRC going now As the hon Member for Glasgow South West Chris Stephens suggested the document is called Building our Future  but its subtitle should be Tearing it down  I concur with him The future of the country really depends on the amount of tax that is put back into the economy in Britain Instead of investing in people who have skills expertise a commitment to public service and institutional memory HMRC is reducing that capacity In 2005 it had 105 000 members of staff but in 2016 it has only 58 000 That is a reduction of nearly 50  HMRC is closing 170 offices presumably to sell off the public estate to developers and replacing them with 13 regional tax centres actually they are call centres It plans to save 100 million but it could recoup that if it closed the tax gap I do not know whether you know this Mr Deputy Speaker but the tax gap is the difference between the tax owed and the tax collected In 2013 14 it amounted to about 34 billion and I think the current figure is about 25 billion That is a lot of money Since 2010 only 11 people have been prosecuted by HMRC despite the fact that it was given a list of 3 600 British people who hid their money in Switzerland Revenue and Customs has not quite worked out that if it has more staff it can collect more tax and that the more people it employs the more tax they pay and contribute to the economy No wonder the wealthy the 1 are laughing all the way to the Cayman Islands The closure of the offices is having a direct impact on my constituency Walsall faces the closure of its HMRC office with the loss of 60 staff My constituent Sahin Kathawala has said that she may not even qualify for one of the relocated jobs If they are lucky staff will have to go to Birmingham where rents are higher so it will be more expensive to live there It will be more expensive for staff to travel to Birmingham so they will incur certain costs My local people in Walsall South will have to telephone a call centre rather than being lucky enough to have face to face contact like that between Dave Hartnett and KPMG The Public Accounts Committee said in 2013 that the telephone services were absolutely abysmal and The Telegraph reported that half of all calls to HMRC were not answered The impact of that could be millions of people paying the wrong amount of tax This week in Walsall we have had the news that BHS might close and who knows what will happen to our local BHS With the closure of the HMRC office nearly l million will be lost from the local economy which Walsall cannot afford to lose PCS says that the plan is designed not to maximise tax collection but to reduce spending which is the opposite of what HMRC s main objective should be What can be done I do not know if you have read The Joy of Tax by Richard Murphy Mr Deputy Speaker but it is very much worth reading I think it should be required reading for everyone including sixth formers In his books on making economics easy which we should all read Ha Joon Chang says that people do not need to be economists to understand economics Richard Murphy has said that HMRC should become a Government Department in its own right subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny and to independent review We need to retain our local tax offices with local staff who have information about the local economy stop the relocation until an equality impact assessment has been done and invest in more staff HMRC must reduce the tax gap not the workforce In that way we can stop the outflow of capital and give back to the public purse all it is owed After all it is the Government who put in the investment in education skills and infrastructure that enable communities companies and the workforce to

2015-2017,gray,neil,25/05/2016,freedom and democracy,0,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Scottish National Party,1553,I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in the debate on the Government s legislative programme for the coming year Given the subject of this debate I should before I begin in earnest declare that my wife is a primary school teacher in Scotland I want to put on the record my welcome for the new Scottish Government team which was announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week particularly new members of the cabinet Derek Mackay and Fergus Ewing I also wish to congratulate newly promoted Ministers Jeane Freeman Kevin Stewart Mark McDonald and Shirley Anne Somerville I look forward to working with all my friends and colleagues in the interests of the people of Scotland It would be remiss of me at this stage not also to pay tribute to colleagues leaving the Scottish Government Richard Lochhead who was Scotland s Rural Affairs Secretary for nine years stood up for Scottish farming and fishing interests and the food and drink sector in an inspiring way My constituency counterpart in Airdrie and Shotts Alex Neil was Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice Communities and Pensioners Rights from 2014 after driving the infrastructure and health portfolios in his typically imaginative and diligent way I wish Alex and Richard all the best I now turn to the subject of today s debate So far the successive days of debate on the Queen s Speech have had far more substance than the Government s programme in itself It was an utterly vacuous Queen s Speech with very little cheer and even less of relevance to the people of Scotland The Scottish National party as the widely acknowledged effective Opposition in this place put forward an alternative Queen s Speech an alternative programme for government and an alternative to austerity We have proposed 15 Bills that we believe the Government should have considered as part of their programme They are Bills of substance that would have made a real difference to people up and down these isles who have been hammered by Tory austerity a political and ideological choice not an economic necessity Although the Bills in the Queen s Speech on education skills training and access to employment the subject of today s debate relate mainly to England or to England and Wales only they serve to highlight the contrasting approach to these important matters between the SNP Scottish Government who have independent powers over education and the Conservative UK Government The great spectre hanging over the higher education and research Bill is of students facing fees of up to and now more than  9 000 a year while Scottish students access their university education without fees I am sure that Members will be interested to note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer promised in a letter to a constituent in 2003 that when next in government the Conservative party would scrap tuition fees altogether  Oh what a damascene conversion we have seen He now wants fees to rise even further Following the elections in Scotland it is now clear that the Government s Tory colleagues up the road are following suit as they are all about backdoor taxes for students as well Government Members and their colleagues in Scotland who benefited from free tuition now wish to pull the ladder up behind them The SNP Government have guaranteed free university tuition in Scotland and that they will maintain the principle that access to university education must be about the ability to learn not the ability to pay It is also worth noting that more of the population in Scotland is educated beyond school than in any other European country with 46 5 educated at tertiary level and that a higher percentage of young people in Scotland now leave school for a positive destination than at any time on record One area where the UK Government sadly retain control over education in Scotland is non EU graduates right to remain and work in the UK after studying here The abolition of the post study work visa for students from outside Europe in 2012 was a regressive step that has reduced our ability to retain world class talents for highly skilled and much needed positions It seems foolish to take the position that it is a good idea for those students to benefit from our world class universities but then disallow ourselves from benefiting from their skills and talents once they have finished their education here The Smith commission report stated that the Scottish and UK Governments should work together to explore the possibility of introducing formal schemes to allow international higher education students graduating from Scottish further and higher education institutions to remain in Scotland and contribute to economic activity for a defined period of time  At the time of the Smith commission s discussions representative organisations including Universities Scotland and NUS Scotland sent it a joint letter warning that the removal of the UK wide post study work visa in 2012 had resulted in a significant fall in the number of international students coming to Scotland At a time when it is crucial as we heard from the Minister for Universities and Science who has left his place that we address skills shortages in key areas of industry to improve productivity and economic growth it is extremely disappointing that this Queen s Speech makes no mention of the reintroduction of the scheme for Scotland In 2015 the Post Study Work working group which was set up by the Scottish Government to provide a view from the business and tertiary education sectors on the impact of the removal of the post study work scheme in Scotland and on how such a scheme should operate if reintroduced concluded  Reintroducing a post study work route in Scotland would benefit both Scottish economic growth and business development as well as enriching the learning experience for all students by attracting more international students to Scotland  In February this year the Holyrood devolution committee made up of MSPs from the five political parties represented there unanimously recommended that the Home Office change its policy on this issue It is extremely disappointing that the UK Government seem unwilling to listen to the views of a diverse range of political parties and organisations in Scotland In our alternative Queen s Speech we have proposed a migration Bill which would include the reintroduction of the post study work visa As was highlighted at Prime Minister s questions by my right hon Friend the Member for Moray Angus Robertson and my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow North Patrick Grady  and after Prime Minister questions by my hon Friend the Member for Ross Skye and Lochaber Ian Blackford  who is the family s local MP the disgraceful treatment of the Brain family shows the desperate need for the reintroduction of the visa There is also an urgent need for changes to the Government s approach on access to employment employment support training and skills which have all been run down by this Government s actions and their reckless cuts to public spending We want an emergency summer Budget to boost investment in public services stimulate GDP growth support wage growth increase tax receipts support trade and exports and boost productivity For all the Tories rhetoric about the long term economic plan the Queen s Speech contains no indication of how the Government will improve productivity employment and growth in the long run Many Government Members will I am sure feel betrayed that there was no mention of the much vaunted White Paper on health and work which was supposed to compensate for the savage cuts to the work related activity group element of the employment and support allowance and to universal credit work allowance A number of Tory Back Benchers were promised jam tomorrow by their Ministers if they withdrew their opposition to those cuts on the basis of the White Paper being published this year Some were right to say as I and others on the SNP Benches did that the White Paper should have been published before the cuts were made because of exactly the scenario that we now see unfolding The cuts to ESA WRAG and universal credit have been made reaping all that social damage and now the supposed replacement has been scrapped The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions used an appearance at the Work and Pensions Committee on 11 May to announce that he was scrapping the proposed White Paper and taking more time to consider a Green Paper He said that he had made it clear in his first statement to this House as Secretary of State that he was looking to push the reset button  That statement was on 21 March I asked him directly that day when the White Paper would be published given that his predecessor the right hon Member for Chingford and Woodford Green Mr Duncan Smith  had told me at his last appearance at the Dispatch Box that it would be well before the summer  and how much money would be committed to it The new Secretary of State could not answer my questions so he made a commitment from the Dispatch Box to write to me on the matter As a follow up I wrote to him on 30 March to remind him of that and request a meeting along with my hon Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan Dr Whiteford  I am still waiting for a reply despite repeatedly chasing the matter up Perhaps one will now be forthcoming The UK Government have wasted precious time by not publishing the White Paper I urge the Secretary of State to come to this House with a date for the publication of the Green Paper Any success in this matter will ultimately be determined by the Government s willingness to engage with community and voluntary organisations as well as experts to help shape any new framework The new Secretary of State at the DWP hopes to have changed the tone of the debate but what we really need is substance He talks about pushing the reset button why then has he not gone back to the brutal cuts to ESA and universal credit or to the lack of assistance to women born in the 1950s regarding their repeatedly delayed and mishandled state pension entitlement an issue that has been commendably spearheaded by the Women Against State Pension Inequality Campaign or to the immoral bedroom tax Why has he not gone back to the much needed reforms to work capability assessments for those with mental health issues and with long term conditions who face the stress of constant unnecessary reassessments and to the waste of money and time as well as additional stress to the claimant because of decisions that should never have been made in the first place that are then overturned at tribunal Why has he not gone back to the two child rule or to the rape clause or to any of the other decisions taken by his predecessor Of all those disastrous policy areas why did he choose to review the White Paper We are concerned that valuable time to make progress on disability employment is being lost as a result of that delay and believe that Ministers should bring forward proposals as soon as possible The announcement of the Green Paper should be welcome if it is brought forward with urgency meaningful engagement with the community and voluntary sector and with experts to shape the new framework However we remain sceptical that the Tories will rise to that challenge and they cannot be allowed to kick this any further into the long grass The Minister must formally make a statement of his intentions and lay out the road map for the development of the new programme with a timeframe With cuts coming down the line for disabled people the Tories must act now Tory Back Benchers will be interested as we are in why the Minister has abandoned the White Paper and we hope that they will join us in calling for progress on the Green Paper to be introduced with haste Forty nine DWP inquiry reports into the deaths of social security recipients were finally released after a long two year freedom of information battle Forty of those reports followed a suicide and in 10 of those cases the recipient had been sanctioned Peer reviews do not make a direct link between DWP policy and those sad deaths but they do highlight the serious problems that are faced by claimants with complex issues mental health challenges or learning support needs I hope that we can now see an end to the unwillingness of Ministers to accept that their policies however well intended they may think they are are having serious consequences and could be costing lives There must be a full urgent review that includes the impact of current work capability assessments the punishing sanctions regime and further cuts to disability support The SNP has proposed a social equality Bill to restore work allowances for low income workers and single parents to end maternity discrimination consider further shared paternity rights for individuals and employers and address barriers to employment for disabled people That would bring matters in line with the principles on which the Scottish Government will found the new Scottish social security agency by treating people with dignity and respect Although the Queen s Speech did not have anything useful to say about those matters at its tail end we were informed that the Government would hold a referendum on membership of the European Union which despite the lacklustre campaign so far will not have come as a revelation to many people That was followed by the vaguest of sentences notifying us that proposals will be brought forward for a British Bill of Rights  Given the vast differences that exist in the Cabinet and on the Government Back Benches about membership of the European Union and the European convention on human rights with many people losing track of who is an in out an out out or an out in it is difficult to imagine how they could find enough common cause to agree on what such a Bill would contain and the Queen s Speech gave no further insight into that For that reason the Bill of Rights is as likely to be brought before the House this year as it was after being mentioned in last year s Queen s Speech The briefing notes for the Queen s Speech on the Bill of Rights added only that  These rights would be based on those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights while also taking into account our common law tradition  That suggests that although the Government are sensibly distancing themselves from the Home Secretary s personal views on the ECHR they have little of substance to say about the purpose or need for such a Bill Professor Mark Elliott from the University of Cambridge stated that in the Queen s Speech  there is no hint of any developed thinking about how the perceived shortcomings of the HRA ought to be addressed or of how reform in this area would be reconciled with the UK s remaining a party to the ECHR  If the Government are unable to provide detailed answers to those points they should question whether attempting to appease some of their own Back Benchers is worth more than having sensible legislation For Scotland the key concern is that the Government have shown little consideration about how that decision will affect the Scottish Parliament and the other devolved legislatures of these isles Briefing notes for the Queen s Speech addressed that issue to pardon the pun only briefly and stated that  Revising the Human Rights Act can only be done by the UK Parliament but we will consult fully before bringing forward proposals  Although it is true that the Scottish Parliament does not have power to alter the Human Rights Act the Law Society of Scotland has argued  Under Devolution Guidance Note 10 DGN10  when UK legislation will alter the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or the Executive Competence of the Scottish Ministers the consent of the Scottish Parliament is needed Repeal and replacement of the Human Rights Act 1998 would in our view require the amendment of the Scotland Act 1998 in those respects which would affect the competences of both the Parliament and Scottish Ministers Any change to the Scotland Act concerning the Human Rights Act 1998 which affects the competence of the Parliament or the Scottish Ministers will in terms of DGN10 require the consent of the Scottish Parliament  Therefore not simply consultation with but consent from the Scottish Parliament would be needed and given that a clear majority in the Scottish Parliament do not support such a change that consent is unlikely to be forthcoming President Theodore Roosevelt famously said that the credit belongs to the man who  spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly  Unfortunately in this case I believe that the Prime Minister and the Government have neither succeeded nor dared greatly but instead have offered a weak and poor programme that will do little to address the needs of the people of these isles Although some measures are to be welcomed such as the likely delivery of a universal service obligation on broadband this Queen s Speech is yet another missed opportunity from the Government to address the key issues Instead of offering clear solutions and innovative ideas I am afraid that in years to come this Queen s Speech will be remembered as an empty vacuous and largely irrelevant sideshow from a governing party that is more concerned about patching over internal divisions on EU membership and jockeying for who will be next Tory leader than about delivering for the people,25/05/2016,11315,Scotland,positive

remembrance and I would particularly like to thank the hon Member for South West Wiltshire Dr Murrison  my hon Friend who in his role as the Prime Minister s special representative for the centenary commemoration of the first world war has done very important work in ensuring that the first world war is commemorated in an appropriate and inclusive way He and I agree that one of the most important reasons for our country to remember is that our country s young people the next generation cannot To them thankfully a war in western Europe seems a distant prospect and my hon Friend deserves generous praise for working to ensure that our next generation has been fully engaged in this process of commemoration Many of us will be attending commemorative events for the Battle of the Somme in the coming days but it is absolutely right that in this place we have the opportunity to pay our respects Organisations and community groups across the country will also be commemorating this centenary I want to pay particular tribute as my hon Friend did to the work that is specifically being done by the Royal British Legion the BBC the Woodland Trust the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Imperial War Museum They have all made a very significant contribution to this process Tonight I want to reflect on the battle itself the contribution made to the war effort by the country and the wider implications of the battle and the first world war itself On the morning of 1 July 1916 the piercing sound of whistles filled the air as men climbed out of their trenches to advance and so began 141 days of the bloodiest battle of world war one Those soldiers were surrounded by their comrades and driven forward by determination duty and fear The prospects of reaching the enemy trenches were grim as whole waves of men fell to the storm of oncoming fire that spread across the battlefield By nightfall some 21 000 would lay dead and 35 000 lay wounded It is hard to comprehend the horror The sound of British artillery guns could be heard across the channel on the south coast of England mines detonated beneath the German trenches shook the ground and within moments cries of the wounded were echoing across the bloodied battlefield For every yard of the 16 mile front there were two British casualties and by the end of the battle more than 1 million soldiers had been killed The terrible price paid by those soldiers reverberated across Europe and indeed the world In the weeks and months that followed families would mourn their loved ones who would never come home This pain was felt in every community across our country Of the 16 000 towns and villages across Britain which dispatched soldiers to war in 1914 only 40 thankful parishes would see the return by 1918 of all who had left for the conflict I visited northern France last year to pay my respects to those who had fallen men who were prepared to face danger to secure freedom for people they would never meet and never know I stood in the trenches they had defended I imagined the terror they must have experienced and walked the ground on which they had fought I knelt in front of their graves It felt like they were a long way from home On occasions such as these it is customary to talk about one s own local unit and I will do so in a moment I remember being in northern France a year ago standing in the trench from which the men of the Devonshire Regiment had begun their attack Those who had fallen now lie buried in the very same trenches from which they had fought There is a plaque marking the spot and it reads  The men of the Devonshire Regiment held this trench They hold it still  Many of those who lost their lives on the Somme were volunteers men who put themselves forward after seeing Lord Kitchener s famous recruiting poster Among them were the Barnsley Pals They were miners steelworkers glassworkers clerks stonemasons and clerics and many of them were friends and neighbours They joined up together they trained together and they went to war together Ultimately many of them died together That story is true not just of the Barnsley Pals but of the many volunteer battalions up and down the country Some signed up through a sense of duty others through a sense of adventure but regardless of their reasons for joining or of where they came from in our country we stand united today to recognise and remember their sacrifice We live in peace and enjoy freedom today because of what they and others did for us That is a legacy that must endure for all time We should also take a moment to acknowledge how the Somme and the first world war in general helped to reshape our society We remember the sacrifice of the men who died at the Somme but Britain s war effort would not have been possible had women not become the backbone of the war effort This ultimately led to the Representation of the People Act 1918 which at long last extended the voting franchise to women It can also be argued that the conflict planted the seeds for the growth of the trade union movement the transformation of the state and the fundamental realignment of British politics that has had a profound impact on our country over the last century This debate also provides us with an important opportunity to pause to remember and to pay tribute to those from the Commonwealth nations who fought alongside British troops There were volunteers from India the West Indies Africa Australia New Zealand and other countries across the globe They were thousands of miles away from home but they were fighting with great courage for what they believed to be right We owe them a debt of gratitude In our debate in this place just a couple of years ago we marked the start of our commemoration of world war one by saying how important it was for it to be a commemoration and not a celebration In that spirit I also want to commemorate the men in the opposite trenches at the Somme who lost their lives during the battle s 141 horrific days I have read the accounts of both German and allied troops who fought at the Somme The accounts are eerily similar and similarly tragic Those in the opposing trenches were not monsters They were young men just like their British and allied counterparts fighting for their country We know that sadly the first world war did not turn out to be the war to end all wars as David Lloyd George had suggested Within two decades war would again engulf our continent but it is a fitting tribute to those who died in both world wars that we now pursue partnerships of peace and are enjoying our longest period without conflict in western Europe for nearly 2 000 years It is comforting to know that what were once fields of war are now fields of peace The historian A J P Taylor once said that idealism died on the Somme I do not believe that that is true and I do not believe that we can allow it to be true We must keep working for a better world a world that stands as a fitting legacy for those who fell at the Somme in those dark days 100 years ago It is a mark of our common decency that we commemorate a war of history but it is a measure of our common humanity that we continue our work today to ensure that such an event never occurs again That is the greatest tribute that we can pay,29/06/2016,12117,England,negative
2015-2017,huq,rupa,04/07/2016,freedom and democracy,1,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Labour,686,I rise to speak as a member of the Justice Committee whose report we are considering I wish to add my hearty congratulations to our Chair the hon Member for Bromley and Chislehurst Robert Neill  on his brilliant opening statement for a while I thought that there was going to be nothing left for me to say and I shall be brief as a result I also want to congratulate our new shadow Lord Chancellor my hon Friend the Member for Leeds East Richard Burgon  I see that the Lord Chancellor is not here perhaps his mind is on other matters What we are considering is far from what he is thinking about at the moment It is worth restating that like all Select Committees the Justice Committee is a majority Conservative Committee but we were pretty unanimous in our conclusions on court and tribunal fees As the Chair pointed out at the start of this debate our inquiry included the criminal courts charge at the beginning Our report on that voiced grave misgivings and recommended the abolition of that unfair charge as soon as possible as it acts as a barrier to justice Encouragingly there has been action on that We welcome the fact that the Government acted swiftly in response to our criticism We now wish that history would repeat itself with the highly unpopular tribunal fees We still await the publication of the Government s long awaited post implementation review of the impact of employment tribunal fees That was announced in June 2015 and our Committee has called for this to happen urgently We recommended that fees for employment tribunals be substantially reduced  However the Opposition would go further and recommend abolition I am proud to have stood on a manifesto at the last general election that urged abolition I do not know what is in our next manifesto Four years is a long way off so I shall not get into Mystic Meg territory Ability to pay or the thickness of the wodge in someone s wallet should not determine their access to justice Fees should not be a barrier to those on low incomes bringing employment tribunal claims That is what I want to address in this short contribution It is a cause for concern that women in particular have been hard hit by employment tribunal fees as shown by the fact that sex discrimination pregnancy maternity and equal pay claims have all fallen The austerity cuts have hit women hardest some analyses show that 80 of all cuts hit women That gives weight to the claim that the Prime Minister he is still the Prime Minister isn t he though not for that much longer has a problem with women It is interesting that the two main runners and riders to replace him are women Let us see what the future brings The Justice Committee interviewed numerous witnesses We had four evidence sessions with 23 people appearing before us and written submissions from 91 stakeholders ranging from pillars of the establishment such as the Bar Council to specialist pressure groups including the self explanatory Pregnant Then Screwed that is its name Maternity Action gave evidence of maternity discrimination and found that on pregnancy discrimination in particular there has been a fall of 40 in the number of claims in the immediate aftermath of the introduction of fees 40 down That is nearly half The group s figures from 2005 suggest that less than 10 of women suffering pregnancy and maternity discrimination would present themselves anyway for fear of repercussions The Under Secretary of State for Justice the hon Member for North West Cambridgeshire Mr Vara  who is a pleasant chap and who is here now told us repeatedly that ACAS has reported an upsurge in people presenting themselves there The figure of 84 000 extra cases for ACAS was mentioned That is not a way to bat away the issue We identified a number of problems Part of the justification for the introduction of fees was to recover costs but in both employment tribunals and the immigration and asylum chamber there has been a massive mismatch between costs and recovery The costs recovered have fallen far short of what was projected According to the Courts and Tribunals Service s annual report for 2014 15 the cost recovery target for employment tribunal fees was set at around 33  Only 17 has been achieved For the immigration and asylum chamber recovery was projected to be around 25  but in reality it has been a measly 9  To add insult to injury the latest accounts from the Ministry of Justice show that in 2014 15 net income from employment tribunal fees was 9 million whereas expenditure on the service was 71 4 million That is a poor ratio The fees make bad business sense Just 12 5 of the costs were recovered at a time of fiscal belt tightening when we should justify every pound of public expenditure We received evidence from the TUC and Thompsons the trade union solicitors that fees have decreased employer engagement with early conciliation Fees act as a disincentive because people wait to see whether the other side can afford them If not there is no point in the public policy initiative to settle before the case gets to the courtroom door My hon Friend the Member for Hammersmith Andy Slaughter talked about claims without merit I will not go into that as I said I would be brief The Government s policies have impacted on access to justice in a number of ways Employment tribunal fees were introduced not in a vacuum but against a background of measures such as the civil court fee increases legal aid cuts restrictions on judicial review the Trade Union Bill and the proposal to repeal the Human Rights Act Some Ministers have mooted leaving the European convention on human rights In our opinion the cumulative effect of all these things is chipping away at access to justice I am a member of Unison which has said  Over the last three years tribunal fees have prevented many people who have been wronged at work from taking their employers to court Unscrupulous bosses can hardly believe their luck They can pretty much treat their staff as badly as they choose safe in the knowledge they are never likely to be taken to a tribunal  Unison is mounting a legal challenge which is due to be heard at the Supreme Court later this year Other stakeholders have voiced similarly damning criticisms The Bar Council called it a shot in the dark  Citizens Advice highlights the anomaly whereby the fees are higher than the sum claimed so they make no business sense The Law Society talks of treating justice like a commodity  Our report says that the overall quantum of fees charged for bringing cases to employment tribunals should be substantially reduced  I say they should be completely abolished In the words of the report  further special consideration should be given to the position of women alleging maternity or pregnancy discrimination  I would drink to that any day I agree with the report s finding that the increase in the divorce petition fee from 410 to 550 be rescinded  and that the review of the employment tribunal fees needs to be published before the Government steam ahead with the hare brained mistaken aim of full costs recovery in the immigration and asylum chamber There are more holes in these policies than in a colander tribunal fees preventing access to justice and trampling on employment rights the reduction in sex discrimination and equal pay claims at the employment tribunal and the delayed publication of the review of employment tribunal fees We should be increasing access to justice not restricting it particularly at a time of austerity,04/07/2016,12241,England,negative

2015-2017,hancock,matthew,13/09/2016,political system,0,38,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Conservative,264,My hon Friend raises an important point I see 10 megabits as the absolute minimum but the definition of what has been advertised in the past for high speed broadband is a really important issue This is not an area of statutory regulation because we do not have statutory regulation for advertising The Advertising Standards Authority makes the rules It is consulting on changing the so called up to definitions in advertising to make sure that there is a tighter definition so that people get what is advertised I think it is fair to say that should that change go through it is a non statutory area it would be widely supported across the House Fibre to new homes was raised by many Members so let me give this answer In January it will become law that superfast broadband needs to be supplied to new homes There is a commitment to provide fibre to sites with more than 100 new premises This is a big step forward Lots of people asked questions about it secondary regulations went through the reason it is not in the Bill is that we think we have made the progress needed to ensure that we deliver in this space Likewise many people asked about agreements on landowners rights under the electronic communications code which I agree is an incredibly important step forward I pay particular tribute to my right hon Friends the Members for Maldon and for Wantage for driving this through The new code will be a baseline that removes a lot of the room for dispute It will apply only to new contracts but many if not most contracts and agreements for siting masts will remain on commercial terms It will not be required to use the new code the new code will be the baseline from which the negotiations can take place Let me touch on the Opposition Front Bench contributions I felt that the two Labour contributions were well informed and the agreement on the vision was very positive I would like to react to a few points Sadly I thought there was a rather shrill position on data sharing and I was slightly disappointed with it Given that we have had two years of open policy making and a full public consultation it was a bit of surprise to hear that the Labour Front Bench team was not involved The hon Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central Chi Onwurah was wrong about the Communications Act 2003 when she said that measures build on Labour s Act and that it was a pity that no progress has been made since 2003 Actually this Bill builds on the Telecommunications Act 1984 The hon Lady was also a bit muddled over the BBC When she argued for more BBC spending power I was not sure whether she wanted the licence fee to be put up I think that making costs for phone masts lower is an important part of rolling out the infrastructure to make sure that we get as much coverage for 5G and 4G as possible We can take up all these points in Committee,13/09/2016,13417,England,positive
2015-2017,quince,will,13/10/2016,welfare and quality of life,0,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,615,The hon Gentleman raises an incredibly good point In the run up to birth people can go to groups such as NCT and prenatal classes so I totally agree We have made friends who have gone through similar experiences You feel that you can talk openly with them because they have gone through very similar experiences and are feeling the same things as you That is very powerful There may be a role that charities and the NHS can play in putting parents where they feel able in touch with other parents who may want to talk about their experience I shall speak briefly about Government targets I know that the Government sometimes get a hard time on the NHS but they have accepted the premise of our argument I remember first meeting my right hon Friend the Member for Ipswich as Minister responsible for care quality it was like pushing at an open door We now have firm commitments to a reduction of 20 by the end of this Parliament and 50 by 2030 It is our job as an all party parliamentary group to hold the Government s feet to the fire and to make sure that they are working towards those targets and that we start to see results I could not let this debate go by without talking about some of the issues that charities have raised with me I shall touch on prevention and then talk about bereavement Research in this area is vital As my hon Friend the Member for Eddisbury said around 50 in fact the figure is 46 of stillbirths and 5 of neonatal deaths are unexplained We need to look for example at ethnicity and ask why south Asian women are 60 more likely to have a stillbirth and why black women are twice as likely to do so Why is there a geographical disparity across the UK I know that part of the answer is social inequality but why is the figure 4 9 in some parts of the UK and 7 1 in others That is around a 25 variation It is not acceptable and we need to understand why it exists We need to look at multiple pregnancies as the hon Member for Livingston Hannah Bardell mentioned from the Scottish National party Front Bench and at lower income families We need to study our European counterparts and see why they are getting it so right and whether we can implement similar measures in the UK Some right hon and hon Members have mentioned public health and they are right to do so Maternal age nutrition and diet drugs alcohol and smoking are all relevant We could achieve a 7 reduction if no woman smoked during pregnancy That is a huge target to achieve and we could do a lot of work on smoking cessation especially during pregnancy Studies show that we could achieve a 12 reduction if no mothers were overweight or obese There is a huge piece of work that we could do on empowering women and mothers to be Initiatives such as Count the Kicks are important Nobody knows their body as well as a mother If she feels that there is something wrong there is a good chance that something is wrong When she picks up the phone to the hospital or to her GP and her concern is dismissed with the words  Don t worry it s not important  she needs to get it checked out If there is nothing to worry about great but on the occasions when we do not get a concern checked out and then something terrible happens we have to hold ourselves responsible There are various initiatives to empower women Teddy s Wish is currently sponsoring fantastic folders as anybody who has had a baby will know mothers to be get purple maternity notes which they carry around religiously just in case the baby comes early The wonderful plastic folders that the maternity notes go in inform mothers and fathers what to look out for what are the signs if something is not right when to pick up the phone when to go and see their GP and when to go to the hospital Such innovation is exactly what is needed Investigation and reporting are important so that we learn the lessons of every stillbirth and neonatal death Covering things up and dismissing them with comments such as  That s unexplained These things happen I m terribly sorry  are unacceptable We have to learn from every case I am pleased that the Government have put a significant amount of money into setting up a system of reporting to enable us to investigate and learn from every stillbirth and neonatal death The hon Member for North Ayrshire and Arran Patricia Gibson rightly mentioned post mortems So many parents are not offered a post mortem One might wonder what parent would want that opportunity but parents who lose children often want to know why They want to understand how and why it happened and how they can make sure that it does not happen again Offered the opportunity many parents opt for a post mortem because they know that that research can help others but clinicians may not be asking the question often with good intentions because it is not an easy question to ask We must ask the question if we are to get post mortem rates up which will feed into the research that will allow us to cut our stillbirth rate An hon Member I apologise I cannot remember who it was mentioned late stage pregnancy scanning In this country we do not scan past 20 weeks We scan at 12 weeks and we scan routinely at 20 weeks but there is no routine scanning past that I find it bizarre that the abnormality scan takes place halfway through the pregnancy but after that the mother to be is not seen again for a scan until she arrives at the hospital when she is in labour Other countries across the world and particularly our counterparts in Europe do scans at 36 weeks or Doppler scans There are huge improvements that we could make in that area I want to clarify one point in relation to prevention The NHS is brilliant and where we get it right in this country we really get it right The problem is the inconsistency across the NHS I know that the Secretary of State and the Minister of State will agree when I say that we have some of the best care in the world but it is important that that is replicated in every hospital and every maternity unit in the country so that whatever hospital a woman goes into and whatever GP she sees she will get the same level of care and consistent advice Even if we manage to achieve our target even if we match our European counterparts and reduce our stillbirth and neonatal death rates by 50  that will still mean between 1 500 and 2 500 parents going through that personal tragedy every year That is why it is important that the APPG puts an equal emphasis on bereavement I have talked about consistency of care across the NHS and there should also be consistency of bereavement pathway and bereavement care across the NHS It is important that we consider aspects such as training for staff I know that Ministers have put huge amounts of funding into training as part of the plan to achieve a significant reduction in the stillbirth

2015-2017,lavery,ian,19/10/2016,freedom and democracy,0,53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Labour,414,I have already said I believe in equalisation but not in the reduction in the number of parliamentary seats from 650 to 600 I firmly believe we should be looking at the equalisation of constituencies but that is not the issue here the issue is the unfairness of reducing the number of MPs while at the same time stuffing the other place ram jam packed with people who are unelected and unaccountable That is totally and utterly unjustified It is inevitable that during this Parliament the Lords will be required once again to properly scrutinise and if necessary overturn the actions of a Government increasingly dominated by right wing populism although in this we must be careful about the recommendations of the Strathclyde report which was a rapid response by the Government to these actions and designed to render the second Chamber toothless against such authoritarian measures In the wake of the Brexit vote the House of Lords must be allowed to get on with its vital role of scrutinising legislation The process is likely to throw up an enormous number of statutory instruments and without the Lords they would probably go through on the nod Labour has long called for reform In the reduction of the Lords and in government we have sought to find consensus It is important to remember that it was a Labour Government who cleared out most of the hereditary peers but we fully acknowledge that fundamental reform is essential Given the vote to leave the EU the Government s boundary review and the political estrangement felt by many voters this is a timely debate We live in a changed society in a modern age where leaps in technology have resulted in an increase in people across the UK becoming more interested in political issues but participatory democracy feels alien to many and with a few noticeable exceptions wanes every year Many people feel that politics is unable to change their lives their area or their country for the better As parliamentarians and politicians we face a huge challenge of how we widen democracy in this country and give people the power to make things better Some people may wonder why the SNP has chosen once again to focus on constitutional issues rather than its day job of governing Scotland but I will leave that to its Members It is very interesting that the party should take such an interest in matters relating to the House of Lords In Scotland s devolved Parliament no such second Chamber exists The forensic scrutiny of the Lords in the UK is said to be provided by the Scottish Parliament s Committee structure but sadly the political balance of those Committees allows the Scottish Government to proceed very much as they wish That said I am happy to inform the House that the Labour party will vote in favour of the SNP motion but this should be only the beginning The Government have many questions to answer on the issue of democracy perhaps the Minister will address them at some stage Will the Government agree to abandon the proposal for boundary changes until a review of the bicameral system in its entirety has been conducted Somebody shouted No from a sedentary position The Minister spoke just before me and pleaded for consensus on our democratic processes but I am not sure whether the hon Member for North Dorset Simon Hoare was present at that point We need to look at the system in its entirety Will the Minister give a guarantee that those Tory MPs who may lose their seats under the proposed boundary changes will not be stuffed into the House of Lords as a solution to the problems that the Conservatives themselves face as a result of those changes When will a plan be put in place to deal with the unwieldy unelected and unaccountable second Chamber and to replace it with something more befitting the 21st century How will we bring democracy back to the communities that feel abandoned by politics We have an opportunity to rebuild democracy in this country making politics relevant to people s lives and to rebuild trust We need to put giving people a real say in their communities and workplaces at the heart of our work as public servants Labour sees transferring power from Westminster Whitehall and indeed the boardroom to our communities as imperative to the future of our democracy We want real devolution of power not the phoney Tory con of regional mayors designed simply to pass on the blame for swingeing cuts Democracy needs to be revived in every nation and region of our country and in every community town and city It must be transparent it must be fair and it must be accountable It must be a major improvement on the current Tory plans We need progress and we need it very quickly We need an agreed workable timeframe Democracy cannot be seen to be ignored it needs to be embraced I am pleased to say that the Opposition will support the motion,19/10/2016,14020,England,positive
2015-2017,quin,jeremy,20/10/2016,economy,0,48,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,472,I suppose the answer depends on the quality of the report Frankly having read it I find that it contains a series of straw men that have been set up for demolition In my view it does not help Members the pensioners or anyone to understand the circumstances of the demise of BHS To put at rest the minds of learned counsel the joint Committees did not object to a dowry being provided on the sale of BHS and certainly did not question its legality However we questioned the sufficiency of the cash and the choice of partner in the circumstances that BHS faced We did not question the concept of a company being sold for 1 Clearly that is a matter for Taveta Investments No 2 Ltd the selling company which received the 1 It is unfortunate that TIL2 which is ultimately controlled by Lady Green is still paying back to Lady Green the 200 million consideration for its acquisition of BHS in 2009 This consideration was satisfied by 200 million of loan stock provided to three overseas companies controlled by Lady Green with a coupon of 8  We would need a much longer debate I am very mindful that other Members wish to participate to draw out all the straw men contained in the joint opinion of learned counsel but several others are produced in the context of corporate governance A rare point on which the joint Committees perspective seems to be shared by learned counsel is on the in our view lax governance of the sale as was so eloquently described by my hon Friend the Member for Bedford However learned counsel state that that is an irrelevance because the shareholders in TIL could in any event provide a direction so the directors were in no position to prevent the sale of BHS to any party That may be true legally but it should raise questions for this House Learned counsel tell us that TIL is 88 owned by Taveta Ltd a company registered in Jersey and 12 by six minority shareholders We are informed that the ultimate beneficial owner of the Jersey company is Lady Green and that under the articles Lady Green acting with any one of the minority shareholders could have directed the sale of BHS at any time and on any terms The right to own and dispose of property under English law is absolutely fundamental and Parliament would be wise to tread very softly but I am concerned in this context about checks and balances not only on the sale but more generally What is the value of a section 172 provision telling directors to have regard to other stakeholders in these circumstances What is the role and purpose of non executive directors especially when the 88 shareholder is not present around the boardroom table To my mind it is not appropriate for directors serving private companies to decide that they can take an approach different from what is good corporate governance purely because they can ultimately be directed That would make it more important especially on major or related transactions and on honouring commitments to pensioners that they should bend over backwards to adhere to strong and demanding codes and be prepared to call out owners if they feel actions are taken that do not have sufficient regard to other stakeholders There are thousands of very successful large and medium sized private companies employing millions and for those millions ownership should be as transparent as good corporate governance There are other issues from which I fear I have been sidetracked by the legal opinion that the House should consider As the hon Member for Hartlepool mentioned corporate governance codes should be applied not only to listed companies but to those owned privately On related party transactions independent valuations or independent opinions are important when such transactions exceed de minimis levels There is the issue of the utility of the requirement to have regard to other stakeholders in section 172 and how directors can be expected to do so when they owe responsibility elsewhere There is the question of the appropriateness of dividend payments above certain thresholds particularly if a pension scheme is in serious deficit I was challenged on that point by the hon Member for Ross Skye and Lochaber Ian Blackford  There is the issue of the requirement for courts to be cognisant of pension deficits as well as of creditors when considering applications for corporate restructurings and capital reductions In private mergers and acquisitions where pension problems may be less transparent than in the listed market consideration should be given to compulsory engagement with the Pensions Regulator and with the trustees For both directors and advisers engaged in sale processes in respect of a company in which the Pensions Regulator has already expressed concern and a sale is not being pre cleared by the Pensions Regulator all parties should be very aware of the actuality of the counterparty to whom they are selling English law requires no due diligence to be done on the buyer nor in my mind should it do so but common sense suggests a certain wariness to be wise In conclusion there are lessons to be learned from this sad story Above all however we are all focused on the loss of a well loved icon the employees who have been made redundant and the pensioners who are rightly worried but whose plight may yet be mitigated by Sir Philip Such an act would indeed be honourable and very welcome I understand from the radio this morning that he is not for the first time planning to meet the regulators in the next few days Time will tell whether pensioners have been waiting for a result or have been made to endure a particularly poorly directed Waiting for Godot,20/10/2016,14073,England,negative

a loyal supporter of the Government from the Back Benches during the past few months and it sounds very much as though he is putting in a job application to the Prime Minister as much as to anyone else Well you never know Another breach of the cap calls into question what its actual point was in the first place As a means to reduce welfare spending it continues to be inflexible and unworkable When we look at the motion and words of the Minister from the Dispatch Box we see a mea culpa The Government are admitting that the cap has in effect gone for the next four years The Minister will not have to continue to come back to the Dispatch Box to say that it is not working because we have now given them a blank cheque for the next three or four years which I guess we should welcome We should really be talking about the fundamentals of the economic circumstances that got us into this situation in the first place We need not the soundbites we used to hear about the long term economic plan but a real plan to make sure that we are boosting investment in productivity in this country The challenge in delivering that has just got a little bit harder as a consequence of Brexit which I suspect is really why we are having this debate today It was always going to be about circumstances and Brexit the fall in the value of the pound the declining confidence in future growth has had the impact of bringing the Government to the Dispatch Box with the display we have seen this evening On social security the Chancellor missed his opportunity to be the reformer he claims to be for just about managing families He should instead have focused on addressing the underlying root causes of poverty by working to address unemployment and employment support We acknowledge that the Government have now had to abandon their own targets on the welfare cap and the projected increases in resources are welcome after they had used the cap for so long as a source for cuts The welfare cap is a reprehensive and regressive measure that places the burden of the UK Government s failed economic strategy on the shoulders of the most disadvantaged in society We should remind ourselves that the welfare cap was a flagship policy for the Government in the last Parliament but it ended up as a tool to find more cuts that the Treasury has used and abused to squeeze resources from the Department for Work and Pensions The new Chancellor will again have to breach the target set for him but we ask him to acknowledge that the sheer fact this Government cannot even stick to their own targets proves that the inflexibility of the welfare cap makes it unworkable The fact that they will breach the cap again and again illustrates a desire not to provide guidance about forgoing the cap for the next four years but to abandon for good the policy of having a cap An arbitrary cap in these times of uncertainty is neither useful nor adequate as the Government s previous breaches have shown The best way to reduce and manage welfare spending is to restore the economy to a healthy state not to hit the most disadvantaged with the bill The cap will not address the underlying structural problems that are keeping people reliant on social security including low pay and wider labour market inequality The fact that people in well paid jobs cannot afford to pay rent because of high housing costs should at least provoke the Government to listen to the point that reliance on welfare is more than what they perceive as a culture of dependency We keep coming back to the issue of housing and housing costs but the only way to address that is to make sure we address the issue of supply in the housing market which the Government have singularly failed to do The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said of the welfare cap target  The Conservative government already has the unimpressive record of meeting nought out of three of its fiscal targets  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said in March 2014  The government s newly announced welfare cap will disproportionately target benefits claimed by the least well off  The IFS green budget from February 2016 said that in practice the welfare cap has proved much less binding Spending is already forecast to exceed the cap that was set in July 2015 for each of the next three fiscal years In other words even though the welfare cap has only been in operation for less than two years since the March 2014 Budget  it has already been broken by the Chancellor It is therefore not clear whether it remains a real constraint on the government s actions  The IFS was right then and is right today What is the point of the welfare cap as a principle if it is breached time and again It is in effect no constraint on what the Government are doing or at least on what they should be doing It is unworkable and meaningless It was simply a sop to show that the Government were talking tough and pays no regard to changing circumstances It is intellectually morally and ethically daft The 1 billion allocation to benefits in the autumn statement is a drop in the ocean with billions of savings still to come from cuts to social security benefits over the next few years Changing the taper rates will not on its own mitigate the impact of those cuts on low income families Instead the Government should reverse cuts to the work allowance in full so that working parents in low paid jobs people whom we as a House should want to support do not lose out Changing that taper rate the rate at which support is withdrawn from low income working households under universal credit will be less effective at targeting support towards low earners with children than simply reversing the cuts to work allowance would be The Scottish National party has consistently argued against the reductions in the work allowance and helped to force a Tory U turn on tax credit cuts last year Although the UK Government kicked the cut to the work allowance down the line it will come back to bite next April hitting just about managing families on low and middle incomes The maximum gain from the 2 reduction in the taper is only around 500 which will fall short of what low and middle income families need to manage when the maximum losses from the work allowance cuts are around 2 800 That is the reality of what is happening under this Government Torsten Bell director of the Resolution Foundation has said  When it comes to boosting just managing family budgets all roads lead to universal credit The most effective way to support families would be by reversing the 3bn cut to work allowances announced by the last chancellor  He added that a modest reduction in the taper rate would leave a bittersweet taste among just about managing families  Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggested the partial U turn would cost 700 million a year by 2020 21 compared with the 3 billion a year taken out of work allowances previously announced Now that the welfare cap has gone why do the Government not reassess these challenges and make sure that they support the families that so desperately need that support With losses for families on universal credit the repugnant rape clause let us not forget that and cuts for the sick and the disabled still to come down the line it is clear the Tories have not abandoned their obsession with austerity For all their rhetoric on the JAMs they are still unwilling to deliver Although it is welcome that there are to be no more welfare spending cuts the sheer fact that the Tories are ploughing ahead with the pre planned cuts next year hitting low and middle income families shows that there are real time cuts for families across the UK in this Parliament In a report to the Scottish Parliament s Social Security Committee researchers from Sheffield Hallam University showed that by 2020 21 Scotland can expect to lose just over 1 billion a year as a result of the latest welfare reforms introduced by the UK Government That is 1 billion of cuts that have yet to hit ordinary working people in Scotland delivered by this Westminster Government happy Christmas Sheffield Hallam University also estimates that the pre 2015 reforms are already costing claimants in Scotland just over 1 1 billion a year That brings the cumulative loss expected from all the post 2010 welfare reforms up to more than 2 billion a year We will not grow the economy by taking cash out of the pockets of the poorest We will fix the economy the debt and the deficit by putting in place measures that will grow the economy This obsession with punishing the poor must stop The UK Government are saving a whopping 30 million in 2017 18 rising to 450 million in 2020 21 from the cuts to the employment and support allowance work related activity group and the component in universal credit according to figures published by the Treasury in the summer Budget 2015 and updated in March 2016 Already we have seen Tory Back Benchers rise again and again to vote with us on the Opposition Benches against those regressive policies Even if the Government will not listen to those of us on the Opposition Benches it is high time they listened to their own Members Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggested the partial U turn on the universal credit taper rate would cost 700 million Why will the Government not do the right thing by the people affected Any move to increase the national living wage as the Government call it is to be welcomed but the UK Government are still dragging their feet they lack the ambition to really tackle low pay The UK Government s national living wage is not a living wage it is simply a further tier of the national minimum wage The real living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living and therefore takes account of the adequacy of household incomes for achieving an acceptable minimum living standard Why will the Government not accept that definition and recognise that that should be the bare minimum for those who are working hard in our society The UK Government s decision to set an arbitrary rate for their national living wage fundamentally challenges the value of having an organisation providing independent advice on wage levels across the UK I therefore ask the Minister will the Government start to accept that impartially provided advice The Scottish National party supports the payment and promotion of the real living wage and in Scotland continues to set the bar on fair work Leading the way on Monday 31 October the First Minister welcomed the new living wage rate of 8 45 per hour which will benefit thousands of staff in Scotland and urged more Scottish organisations to sign up as accredited living wage employers That rise of 20p will benefit thousands of employees at living wage accredited organisations in Scotland The best way to reduce and manage welfare spending is to restore the economy to a healthy state not to hit the most disadvantaged with the bill Austerity is a choice not a necessity an obsession that has been proved time and again to fail It is time for an economic strategy that focuses on inclusive and fair growth The SNP is delivering for Scotland Westminster is delivering ongoing austerity We are all paying the price for that Question put and agreed to Resolved That pursuant to the Charter for Budget Responsibility Autumn 2015 update which was approved by this House on 14 October 2015 under Section 1 of the Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 this House agrees that the breach of the Welfare Cap in 2019 20 and 2020 21 due to higher forecast inflation and spend on disability benefits is justified and that no further debate will be

detail This has been talked about as a forgotten crisis although not in the House and certainly not in my constituency I am delighted to say that the Yemeni community in Cardiff has a long history and it has long expressed its concerns to me about the situation That community is also willing to reach out to Yemen Before Christmas I was delighted to support the Disasters Emergency Committee campaign in raising funds for Yemen The campaign had already been very publicly supported by Grangetown Primary School in my constituency by TramShed and by the Cardiff Devils ice hockey team That unusual coalition came together to make it clear that they did not want the scenes that we saw on TV over Christmas of people suffering and starving those horrific scenes that the hon Member for Portsmouth South Mrs Drummond and other Conservative Members referred to to continue I agree with the comments made by many Members across the House about the need for an absolute focus on securing a ceasefire and a peace settlement Only through that can we truly address the horrors that we see in Yemen and the situation that Stephen O Brien rightly described as a humanitarian catastrophe Oxfam International states that 7 million people do not know where their next meal will come from and we have all seen those horrible images on our screens The UN and World Health Organisation estimate that 18 8 million Yemeni citizens almost two thirds of the population are in dire need of assistance and protection As of 25 October last year health facilities reported that there had been almost 44 000 casualties which is an average of 75 people killed or injured every day There are 3 15 million internally displaced people We have heard about the import restrictions at ports and the crisis in accessing food that has been caused by food shortages Oxfam reports that almost half a million infants and young people are in need of immediate treatment for severe acute malnutrition The war has led to the collapse of food imports Yemen imported 90 of its food supplies before the escalation of the conflict In November 2015 the country imported enough food supplies to meet demands but in October 2016 imported food covered only 40 of the demand Many aid agencies are warning that if the plunging trends in food imports continue unabated they may come to a complete halt in four months There is a risk of a cholera outbreak because the restrictions on fuel imports are having a catastrophic effect on Yemen s water and sanitation infrastructure There has been an extremely worrying rise in gender based violence especially sexual violence domestic violence and early marriage Reports indicate an increase of 70 in reported incidents today compared with March 2015 and 8 000 or more incidents were recorded between January and September 2016 with 64 of the cases defined as emotional and psychological abuse or physical assault The psychological impact of the conflict on children let alone the physical impact is absolutely appalling I will read out the words of 13 year old Wahiha  I see the damage everywhere and I see how many people are affected by the bombs I feel scared when I see weapons and especially when I hear the sound of planes up in the sky When you hear that sound it means a big explosion will follow and that people will be killed  Hospitals and schools are damaged too For children there is no education any more Life is very difficult in Yemen right now  That is a powerful testimony from one of the young people living through the conflict The UN tells us that 3 000 children have been killed or injured since March 2015 I pay tribute as others have done to the DFID team working in Yemen Our Committee s report found that DFID had been instrumental in supporting and facilitating the humanitarian relief effort through its timely and flexible response and we commended the Department for that DFID has more than doubled its humanitarian commitment to Yemen making the UK the fourth largest donor last year DFID s work is crucial evidence of why we need to adhere to our 0 7 aid commitment To do so is not only morally right but in our national and global interest I believe as I have done for a long time that such excellent work risks being undermined by the continued sale to Saudi Arabia of arms that are being used in Yemen Let me be clear from the outset that I accept the very serious concerns that have been raised about the wider regional nature of the conflict I do not have an agenda against Saudi Arabia nor do I have an agenda against our defence industry I believe in a regulated defence industry that adheres to the rule of law The reality is that the UN estimates that more than 60 of civilian casualties were the result of attacks by the Saudi led coalition We might as well look at the current evidence we have heard in the last few days about a Saudi led coalition airstrike that was reported to have killed five people including two children near a primary school in the north of Yemen That is just in recent days We have heard about the atrocities committed by the Houthis and I want to be clear that I recognise and condemn them We heard some absolutely disgusting stories about the use of child soldiers The Houthis are blockading humanitarian access and using landmines and other indiscriminate weapons just as cluster munitions are against civilians They have carried out appalling indiscriminate artillery attacks at Taiz and along the borders in which they have killed civilians We are not selling arms to the Houthis however we are selling arms to the Saudi led coalition Human Rights Watch reports that 61 allegedly unlawful coalition actions and airstrikes have resulted in the death of 900 civilians and there have been attacks on markets schools and hospitals My hon Friend the Member for Hyndburn Graham Jones asked who was dropping these bombs and where they were coming from Human Rights Watch suggests that US supplied munitions were used at 23 of those locations UK made weapons including one produced as recently as 2015 have also been found there Let us be absolutely clear The UK is a signatory to the arms trade treaty and we led the fight for it internationally I am proud of the fact that there was cross party support for it and that successive Governments have driven it forward We have signed up to the EU consolidated criteria and we have our own regulations which are very clear A legal opinion has been produced which states that the UK is potentially in breach of article 6 3 of the arms trade treaty because the Government ought to have had the necessary knowledge that serious violations of international law were taking place that the UK may be in breach of article 7 because there is a clear risk that future weapons supplies could be used to commit or facilitate serious breaches of international law and that in such an ongoing crisis no feasible mitigation measures were deemed possible The position is clear we are signed up to those restrictions Unfortunately we have had a series of obfuscations and confusions not only from the Saudis but from the UK Government who changed their position several times on whether they conducted assessments the nature of those assessments and the date on which they were conducted The Minister and others admitted that progress has been glacial That is simply not acceptable As the right hon Member for North East Bedfordshire Alistair Burt  a former Foreign Minister pointed out the Saudi Foreign Minister visited twice That was a great opportunity to question him He gave us assurances that there would be responses to the investigations yet we have not seen them There are more than 180 documented incidents Clearly some will prove not to be true but that is why we need a thorough investigation and progress to date has been slow whether from the Saudi Government and the Joint Incident Assessment Team or the UK Government who I believe know full well what is going on and have conducted assessments and possess information to show whether atrocities have been committed against civilians We need independent verification of what has gone on Until we get that I support the calls for a temporary suspension of arms sales because of the principles that the arms trade treaty sets out I hope that the Minister will give us some clear assurances about what assessments and investigations are happening and whether he is convinced that the UK is adhering to its legal obligations We know that legal proceedings are ongoing and due to be in the courts soon It is crucial that before those proceedings the UK Government are clear about what they knew and when they knew it because we need assurances that we are adhering to our international obligations The crisis in Yemen will be resolved only through a peace settlement and a negotiated solution All our efforts must be focused on that There is a great deal of unity on that in the House on the need for a humanitarian and development response and indeed on the need for an independent investigation We have a part to play in that we are selling arms to one of the parties Until we have clear answers I will remain unsatisfied,12/01/2017,16893,England,negative

2015-2017,philp,chris,24/01/2017,social groups,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,709,I beg to move That leave be given to bring in a bill to regulate industrial action by those providing certain critical national services to define critical national services to include railways operators providing buses trams and underground railways the National Health Service and fire and ambulance services to require those taking industrial action in relation to critical national services to demonstrate that the matter in dispute is such that the adverse effects on the provision of service to the public caused by the action is proportionate and reasonable to provide for the High Court in England and Wales and the Court of Session in Scotland to adjudicate on proportionality and reasonableness of action and to determine a minimal required level of service to the public to be provided in the case of such action taking place and for connected purposes Trade unions have a long history of campaigning for workers rights stretching back to the 19th century Trade unions ushered in an era of regulated working hours holiday pay sick pay maternity pay health and safety at work and decent wages I applaud those achievements fought for by trade unions and made law by past Parliaments I respect what trade unions have achieved in the past 150 years and I understand that the right to strike is inseparable from the struggles that led to these victories that have helped to civilise our country But we must also recognise that strikes have a profound effect on the wider public especially where those strikes occur on critical national services It is time to consider again the impact that strikes have on the wider public and to protect the public as well as uphold the right to strike A few weeks ago I received a heart rending message from a constituent Jenny Lehane She said that tears were streaming down her face as she wrote about the effect of the recent Southern Railway strikes on her family She wrote that she had to get her six year old son to walk to a bus stop at 5 30 in the morning when the trains were not running so that she could get to work and her son could get to school She said those responsible should hang their heads in shame  and she attached a photo of her son trudging disconsolately down a cold dark street wrapped in his blanket That is the human impact of nearly 40 days of strike action that the RMT and ASLEF have taken in the past few months most recently only yesterday to say nothing of the unofficial strike action and work to rule that have been taking place on non strike days The operator Southern rail must shoulder a great deal of blame I am not here to defend it in fact I think it should lose the franchise But there is no question that the strike action has made a bad service unusable in the last six months In this case I do not believe that the unions have a substantial complaint No one is losing their job No one is getting a pay cut Every single train currently scheduled to run with two members of staff will continue to be scheduled to run with two members of staff The dispute centres simply on who opens and closes the doors and whether the train can still run if the conductor does not turn up for work The rail regulator says that there is no safety issue contrary to the union position In fact millions of trains have run perfectly safely since 1984 including 1 5 million trains in the last five years without a single fatality All of London underground runs with driver operated doors perfectly safely as does most of continental Europe The RMT is disputing these issues simply to retain its ability to shut down the rail network in the course of future strike action by its conductors It is on this flimsy pretext that 400 conductors are preventing 300 000 people from getting to work or getting home to see their loved ones Sue Gaitskell had to quit her job as a sales manager My constituent Lee Fenton was fired from his job working for a local council Emma Green had to quit her job as a commercial lawyer Many people are having to consider moving home It is just not acceptable that the rights of these people are not being adequately protected I am afraid to say that there are signs that this kind of industrial action hugely disruptive to the public but based on a flimsy pretext is spreading Merseyrail and Great Northern are apparently next in the union s sights and two weeks ago London ground to a halt due to an RMT strike on the underground over changes that were in fact introduced some time ago I am pleased that the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan to his great credit condemned the RMT underground strike without reservation but it is very disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition did not follow the Mayor s example Far from following the Mayor of London s fine example he said that instead of siding with the public he would in fact join the picket line Indeed The president of the RMT a man called Sean Hoyle did not even bother to disguise his motives He was recently filmed speaking to a group of trade unionists saying that the strikes had the objective of bringing down the Government  those are his words not mine Mr Hoyle is entitled to his political views but he is not entitled to use the power he has as the president of a major trade union to inflict misery on hundreds of thousands of people simply in furtherance of his nakedly political objectives We now need further legislation to recognise the public s right to get to work to see loved ones or to receive medical treatment as well as respecting the unions right to strike which I fully accept We in Parliament should not stand by and allow strike action to cause people to lose their own jobs This Bill goes further than previous legislation and proposes that strikes on critical national services such as the railways tubes buses and NHS should be proportionate and reasonable in the view of a High Court judge in order to be lawful The judge would weigh up the complaint of the striking workers against the impact on the wider public in deciding what is proportionate and reasonable  and where strikes were allowed the judge would specify a level of basic service that would be available during any strike The law in Canada Spain and Italy already works in a similar way guaranteeing a basic level of service A poll published in yesterday s Evening Standard found that 55 of Londoners support these proposals and public support for them is growing daily Many other Members support these proposals too In a similar vein my hon Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle Huw Merriman  who is in his place is introducing his own ten minute rule Bill on 4 February to stipulate that strikes based on the pretext of safety concerns cannot proceed unless the relevant regulator agrees that there is a safety issue I do not for one moment dispute the right to strike but the public also have a right to get to work and not be forced out of their own jobs by union action A fair balance is needed between the two and I am afraid to say that current legislation does not provide it If there is a Division in order to support this motion today Members do not need to agree with the precise details of the Bill For example Members may think that there are better methods of arbitrating between the rights of the unions and the rights of the public than through a High Court judge some have suggested to me in the last few days that Parliament itself might be an alternative But if the House supports this motion we are sending a simple message that the public have rights as well as trade unions and that it is Parliament s duty to protect the public as well This Bill is about balance and fairness and I commend it to the House,24/01/2017,17338,England,negative

2015-2017,heald,oliver,15/03/2017,fabric of society,0,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Conservative,302,First may I congratulate the hon Member for Rochdale Simon Danczuk on securing this debate and on his interesting and thoughtful contribution It is right to say at the outset that the Government are considering family justice matters at the moment with a view to having a Green Paper later this year With that in mind he has highlighted an important concern I was sorry to hear of his own personal experience of parental alienation which must make this an issue of particular concern to him and the House will have been moved by that I am sure that everyone in the House will agree that parental separation is one of the most traumatic events for a family It affects both the child and the parents Many separated parents do manage to overcome that agony of separation and work out child arrangements in a way that values and encourages the ongoing involvement of each other and the hon Gentleman mentioned his own experience of doing that Other parents for a variety of reasons find themselves in conflict with each other when faced with the need to make important decisions together about the future of themselves and their children All too often the needs of the children are lost in that emotional turmoil The breakdown of a relationship presents its own difficulties for children The emotional upheaval of separation is made worse when one parent more commonly but not always the parent with whom the child resides seeks to turn the child against the other parent and make them appear anxious in their presence Although there is no generally recognised syndrome as the hon Gentleman called it of parental alienation in this jurisdiction it does not mean that the problem is unrecognised by the family justice system What matters is not whether parental alienation is a syndrome but what the impact is on the child The Government are aware of the difficulties that a parent can face when the other parent seeks to alienate them from their child s life and I am sure that hon Members know that from their own constituency work because it is a point that comes up in surgeries Such behaviour can never be acceptable and it has a traumatic effect Like domestic abuse it can intensify emotional harm to children However I can assure hon Members that the law takes the matter seriously There are mechanisms in place robustly to address parental alienation when it features in child arrangements cases before the family court When a parent applies for a child arrangements order determining with whom their child is to live or spend time the court must by law presume that the child s welfare will be furthered by that parent s involvement in their life unless there is clear evidence to the contrary When making any decision about the nature of that involvement the child s welfare is always paramount but that presumption applies This position contrasts starkly with the issue that we are debating this evening involving parents who unilaterally seek to undermine the importance of that law which attaches importance to both parents involvement always assuming that it is safe and in the child s best interests to do so Where the court is dealing with a child arrangements dispute the Children Act 1989 sets out what is known as the welfare checklist which includes having regard to factors such as the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned commensurate with that child s age and level of understanding If the court is concerned about what those wishes genuinely are and the feelings involved it can request the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service CAFCASS to prepare a welfare report about the child s wishes and feelings as well as any other any matters relevant to the case,15/03/2017,19474,England,negative

2015-2017,powell,lucy,23/03/2017,welfare and quality of life,1,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Labour,242,I very much thank Lord Adonis for all his work and indeed my hon Friend the Member for Liverpool West Derby Stephen Twigg  who was a Minister at the time of the London initiative The London challenge was one of those Government initiatives that achieved real change including the biggest rise in attainment we have seen in an area The opportunity areas developed by the right hon Member for Loughborough during her time in office are good successors but they need to be matched by resources and the ability to attract and retain the best teachers The pupil premium has been a remarkable development that has allowed those who are behind to begin to catch up during their time in school Let us follow these learnings and not get distracted by things that do not work By the age of 25 many of these children will be in low skilled low paid jobs Only one in 10 low paid workers will ever escape low pay That is a pretty terrible outcome for them and our country and as I said those jobs are disappearing too Our skills strategy for post 16 and in work training needs strengthening I welcome the Government s moves in this area Proposals such as T levels the apprenticeship levy and the skills plan linked to the industrial plan are all very much to be welcomed Although I have some criticisms of the way in which initiatives such as university technical colleges are working they are a good idea but they do need more focus and work Let us not implement some of these good initiatives badly however and lose what we know works For example on T levels we need to make sure that we continue to have the blend of technical and academic that will be so important for the jobs of the future If we look at all our OECD competitor countries it clear that it is critical that children continue to work on maths and English to a high level right to the age of 18 The post 16 reforms also need matching with other reforms such as pathways out of university As I said earlier the underperformance and under skilled jobs of many of our graduates fundamentally need addressing Access to the professions is key and other Members will talk about that Those are just three of the key areas that can drive social mobility the early years what happens in schools and post 16 but we also know what does not work in terms of social mobility and I want to talk about that for a minute One thing that does not work is grammar schools Unfortunately under the current Prime Minister grammar schools and selection seem to take centre stage in her vision for dealing with social mobility They are sucking up all the oxygen in the debate yet the evidence is clear they do nothing for social mobility in fact they make it worse,23/03/2017,19667,England,positive
